We will show how to convert this NFA N to a DFA M that accepts the
same language. Following the proof of Theorem 2.5.1, the DFA M is speciﬁed
by M = (Q′, Σ, δ′, q′, F ′), where each of the components is deﬁned below.
• Q′ = P(Q). Hence,
Q′ = {∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.
• q′ = Cϵ({q}). Hence, the start state q′ of M is the set of all states of
N that can be reached from N’s start state q = 1, by making zero or
more ϵ-transitions. We obtain
q′ = Cϵ({q}) = Cϵ({1}) = {1, 2}.
• F ′ = {R ∈Q′ : R ∩F ̸= ∅}. Hence, the accept states of M are those
states that contain the accept state 2 of N. We obtain
F ′ = {{2}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.
