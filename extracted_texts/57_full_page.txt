Figure 2.1: The NFA M accepts L(M1) ∪L(M2).
Proof.
Since A1 is regular, there is, by Theorem 2.5.2, an NFA M1 =
(Q1, Σ, δ1, q1, F1), such that A1 = L(M1). Similarly, there is an NFA M2 =
(Q2, Σ, δ2, q2, F2), such that A2 = L(M2). We may assume that Q1 ∩Q2 = ∅,
because otherwise, we can give new “names” to the states of Q1 and Q2.
From these two NFAs, we will construct an NFA M = (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F), such
that L(M) = A1 ∪A2. The construction is illustrated in Figure 2.1. The
NFA M is deﬁned as follows:
1. Q = {q0} ∪Q1 ∪Q2, where q0 is a new state.
2. q0 is the start state of M.
3. F = F1 ∪F2.
4. δ : Q × Σϵ →P(Q) is deﬁned as follows: For any r ∈Q and for any
