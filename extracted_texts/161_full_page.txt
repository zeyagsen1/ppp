4.2 Construct a Turing machine with one tape, that accepts the language
{w : w contains twice as many 0s as 1s}.
Assume that, at the start of the computation, the tape head is on the leftmost
symbol of the input string.
4.3 Let A be the language
A
=
{ w ∈{a, b, c}∗
:
w contains more bs than as and
w contains more cs than as }.
Give an informal description (in plain English) of a Turing machine with one
tape, that accepts the language A.
4.4 Construct a Turing machine with one tape that receives as input a non-
negative integer x and returns as output the integer x + 1.
Integers are
represented as binary strings.
Start of the computation: The tape contains the binary representation
of the input x. The tape head is on the leftmost symbol and the Turing
machine is in the start state q0. For example, if x = 431, the tape looks as
follows:
. . . 2 2 2 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2
. . .
6
End of the computation: The tape contains the binary representation of
the integer x + 1. The tape head is on the leftmost symbol and the Turing
machine is in the ﬁnal state q1. For our example, the tape looks as follows:
. . . 2 2 2 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 2
. . .

The Turing machine in this exercise does not have an accept state or a
reject state; instead, it has a ﬁnal state q1. As soon as state q1 is entered,
the Turing machine terminates. At termination, the contents of the tape is
the output of the Turing machine.
