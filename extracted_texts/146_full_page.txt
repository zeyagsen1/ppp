Figure 4.1: A Turing machine with k = 2 tapes.
2. Each tape has a tape head which can move along the tape, one cell
per move. It can also read the cell it currently scans and replace the
symbol in this cell by another symbol.
3. There is a state control, which can be in any one of a ﬁnite number of
states. The ﬁnite set of states is denoted by Q. The set Q contains
three special states: a start state, an accept state, and a reject state.
The Turing machine performs a sequence of computation steps. In one
such step, it does the following:
1. Immediately before the computation step, the Turing machine is in a
state r of Q, and each of the k tape heads is on a certain cell.
2. Depending on the current state r and the k symbols that are read by
the tape heads,
(a) the Turing machine switches to a state r′ of Q (which may be
equal to r),
(b) each tape head writes a symbol of Γ in the cell it is currently
scanning (this symbol may be equal to the symbol currently stored
in the cell), and
