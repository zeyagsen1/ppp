where ∅indicates that the stack is empty.
Assume that $
∗⇒a1a2 . . . an. Then there exists a derivation (using the
rules of R) of the string a1a2 . . . an from the start variable $. We may assume
that in each step in this derivation, a rule is applied to the leftmost variable
in the current string. Hence, because the grammar G is in Chomsky normal
form, at any moment during the derivation, the current string has the form
a1a2 . . . ai−1AkAk−1 . . . A1,
(3.2)
for some integers i and k with 1 ≤i ≤n + 1 and k ≥0, and variables
A1, A2, . . . , Ak. (In particular, at the start of the derivation, we have i = 1
and k = 1, and the current string is Ak = $. At the end of the derivation,
we have i = n + 1 and k = 0, and the current string is a1a2 . . . an.)
We will deﬁne the pushdown automaton M in such a way that the current
string (3.2) corresponds to the conﬁguration

Based on this discussion, we obtain the nondeterministic pushdown au-
tomaton M = (Σ, V, {q}, δ, q), where
• the tape alphabet is the set Σ of terminals of G,
• the stack alphabet is the set V of variables of G,
• the set of states consists of one state q, which is the start state, and
• the transition function δ is obtained from the rules in R, in the following
way:
