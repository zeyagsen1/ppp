Context-Free Languages
– For each rule in R that is of the form A →BC, with A, B, C ∈V ,
the pushdown automaton M has the instructions
qaA →qNCB, for all a ∈Σ.
– For each rule in R that is of the form A →a, with A ∈V and
a ∈Σ, the pushdown automaton M has the instruction
qaA →qRϵ.
– If R contains the rule $ →ϵ, then the pushdown automaton M
has the instruction
q2$ →qNϵ.
This concludes the deﬁnition of M. It remains to prove that L(M) =
L(G), i.e., the language of the nondeterministic pushdown automaton M is
equal to the language of the context-free grammar G. Hence, we have to
show that for every string w ∈Σ∗,
w ∈L(G) if and only if w ∈L(M),
which can be rewritten as
$
∗⇒w if and only if M accepts w.
Claim 3.7.2 Let a1a2 . . . an be a string in Σ∗, let A1, A2, . . . , Ak be variables
in V , and let i and k be integers with 1 ≤i ≤n + 1 and k ≥0. Then the
following holds:
$
∗⇒a1a2 . . . ai−1AkAk−1 . . . A1
if and only if there exists a computation of M from the initial conﬁguration
