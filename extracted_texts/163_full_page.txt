End of the computation: The ﬁrst and second tapes are empty. The third
tape contains the binary representation of the product xy and its head is on
the rightmost bit of xy. The Turing machine is in the ﬁnal state q1.
Hint: Use the Turing machines of Exercises 4.5 and 4.7.
4.9 Construct a Turing machine with one tape that receives as input a string
of the form 1n for some integer n ≥0; thus, the input is a string of n many
1s. The output of the Turing machine is the string 1n21n. Thus, this Turing
machine makes a copy of its input.
The input alphabet is Σ = {1} and the tape alphabet is Γ = {1, 2}.
Start of the computation: The tape contains a string of the form 1n, for
some integer n ≥0, the tape head is on the leftmost symbol, and the Turing
machine is in the start state. For example, if n = 4, the tape looks as follows:
. . . 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2
. . .

End of the computation: The tape contains the string 1n21n, the tape
head is on the 2 in the middle of this string, and the Turing machine is in
the ﬁnal state. For our example, the tape looks as follows:
. . . 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2
. . .

The Turing machine in this exercise does not have an accept state or a
reject state; instead, it has a ﬁnal state. As soon as this state is entered, the
Turing machine terminates. At termination, the contents of the tape is the
output of the Turing machine.
