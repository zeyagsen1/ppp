Closure under the regular operations
In Section 2.3, we have deﬁned the regular operations union, concatenation,
and star. We proved in Theorem 2.3.1 that the union of two regular lan-
guages is a regular language. We also explained why it is not clear that the
concatenation of two regular languages is regular, and that the star of a reg-
ular language is regular. In this section, we will see that the concept of NFA,
together with Theorem 2.5.2, can be used to give a simple proof of the fact
that the regular languages are indeed closed under the regular operations.
We start by giving an alternative proof of Theorem 2.3.1:
Theorem 2.6.1 The set of regular languages is closed under the union op-
eration, i.e., if A1 and A2 are regular languages over the same alphabet Σ,
then A1 ∪A2 is also a regular language.
