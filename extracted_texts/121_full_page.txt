Figure 3.1: A pushdown automaton.
(a) the pushdown automaton switches to a state r′ of Q (which may
be equal to r),
(b) the tape head either moves one cell to the right or stays at the
current cell, and
(c) the top symbol A is replaced by a string w that belongs to Γ∗. To
be more precise,
i. if w = ϵ, then A is popped from the stack, whereas
ii. if w = B1B2 . . . Bk, with k ≥1 and B1, B2, . . . , Bk ∈Γ, then
A is replaced by w, and Bk becomes the new top symbol of
the stack.
Later, we will specify when the pushdown automaton accepts the input
string.
We now give a formal deﬁnition of a deterministic pushdown automaton.
Deﬁnition 3.5.1 A deterministic pushdown automaton is a 5-tuple M =
(Σ, Γ, Q, δ, q), where
