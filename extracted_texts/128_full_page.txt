3.7
Equivalence of pushdown automata and
context-free grammars
The main result of this section is that nondeterministic pushdown automata
and context-free grammars are equivalent in power:
Theorem 3.7.1 Let Σ be an alphabet and let A ⊆Σ∗be a language. Then
A is context-free if and only if there exists a nondeterministic pushdown
automaton that accepts A.
We will only prove one direction of this theorem. That is, we will show
how to convert an arbitrary context-free grammar to a nondeterministic push-
down automaton.
Let G = (V, Σ, R, $) be a context-free grammar, where V is the set of
variables, Σ is the set of terminals, R is the set of rules, and $ is the start
variable. By Theorem 3.4.2, we may assume that G is in Chomsky normal
form. Hence, every rule in R has one of the following three forms:
1. A →BC, where A, B, and C are variables, B ̸= $, and C ̸= $.
2. A →a, where A is a variable and a is a terminal.
3. $ →ϵ.
We will construct a nondeterministic pushdown automaton M that ac-
cepts the language L(G) of this grammar G. Observe that M must have the
following property: For every string w = a1a2 . . . an ∈Σ∗,
w ∈L(G) if and only if M accepts w.
This can be reformulated as follows:
$
∗⇒a1a2 . . . an
if and only if there exists a computation of M that starts in the initial
conﬁguration
