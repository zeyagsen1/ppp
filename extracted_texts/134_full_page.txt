of variables is well-deﬁned.
Observe that this sequence consists of r + 1
variables. Since the number of variables in the grammar G is equal to r,
the pigeonhole principle implies that there is a variable that occurs at least
twice in this sequence. In other words, there are indices j and k, such that
ℓ−1 −r ≤j < k ≤ℓ−1 and Aj = Ak. Refer to the ﬁgure below for an
illustration.

Recall that T is a parse tree for the string s. Therefore, the terminals
stored at the leaves of T, in the order from left to right, form s. As indicated
in the ﬁgure above, the nodes storing the variables Aj and Ak partition s
into ﬁve substrings u, v, x, y, and z, such that s = uvxyz.
It remains to prove that the three properties stated in the pumping lemma
