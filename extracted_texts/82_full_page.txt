• q: start state; no symbol has been read.
• q01: the last symbol read was 1; in the part of the string read so far, the
number of occurrences of 01 is one more than the number of occurrences
of 10.
• q10: the last symbol read was 0; in the part of the string read so far, the
number of occurrences of 10 is one more than the number of occurrences
of 01.
• q0
equal: the last symbol read was 0; in the part of the string read so far,
the number of occurrences of 01 is equal to the number of occurrences
of 10.
• q1
equal: the last symbol read was 1; in the part of the string read so far,
the number of occurrences of 01 is equal to the number of occurrences
of 10.
The set of accept states is equal to {q, q0
equal, q1
equal}. The state diagram of
the DFA is given below.

In fact, the key property mentioned above implies that the language A
consists of the empty string ϵ and all non-empty binary strings that start
