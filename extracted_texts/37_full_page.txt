• Σ = {0, 1},
• the start state is q,
• the set F of accept states is equal to F = {q101}, and
• the transition function δ is given by the following table:
0

q

q1

q10

The ﬁgure below gives the state diagram of the ﬁnite automaton M =
(Q, Σ, δ, q, F).

This ﬁnite automaton accepts the language A consisting of all binary
strings that contain the substring 101. As an exercise, how would you obtain
a ﬁnite automaton that accepts the complement of A, i.e., the language
consisting of all binary strings that do not contain the substring 101?
2.2.3
A third example of a ﬁnite automaton
The ﬁnite automata we have seen so far have exactly one accept state. In
this section, we will see an example of a ﬁnite automaton having more accept
states.
