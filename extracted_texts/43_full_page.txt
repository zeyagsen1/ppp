Nondeterministic ﬁnite automata

automata seem to be more powerful than their deterministic counterparts.
We will prove, however, that DFAs have the same power as NFAs. As we will
see, using this fact, it will be easy to prove that the class of regular languages
is closed under the concatenation and star operations.
2.4
Nondeterministic ﬁnite automata
We start by giving three examples of nondeterministic ﬁnite automata. These
examples will show the diﬀerence between this type of automata and the
deterministic versions that we have considered in the previous sections. After
these examples, we will give a formal deﬁnition of a nondeterministic ﬁnite
automaton.
2.4.1
A ﬁrst example
Consider the following state diagram:
q1
q2
q3
q4
0,1
1
0,ε
1
0,1
You will notice three diﬀerences with the ﬁnite automata that we have
seen until now. First, if the automaton is in state q1 and reads the symbol 1,
then it has two options: Either it stays in state q1, or it switches to state q2.
Second, if the automaton is in state q2, then it can switch to state q3 without
reading a symbol; this is indicated by the edge having the empty string ϵ as
label. Third, if the automaton is in state q3 and reads the symbol 0, then it
cannot continue.
Let us see what this automaton can do when it gets the string 010110 as
input. Initially, the automaton is in the start state q1.
• Since the ﬁrst symbol in the input string is 0, the automaton stays in
state q1 after having read this symbol.
• The second symbol is 1, and the automaton can either stay in state q1
or switch to state q2.
