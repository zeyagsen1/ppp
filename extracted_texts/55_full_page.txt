We make the following observations:
• The states {1} and {1, 3} do not have incoming edges. Therefore, these
two states cannot be reached from the start state {1, 2}.
• The state {3} has only one incoming edge; it comes from the state
{1}. Since {1} cannot be reached from the start state, {3} cannot be
reached from the start state.
• The state {2} has only one incoming edge; it comes from the state
{3}. Since {3} cannot be reached from the start state, {2} cannot be
reached from the start state.
Hence, we can remove the four states {1}, {2}, {3}, and {1, 3}. The
resulting DFA accepts the same language as the DFA above.
This leads
to the following state diagram, which depicts a DFA that accepts the same
language as the NFA N:
