Context-Free Languages
Therefore, we have
S = q = r0 ⇒w1r1 ⇒w1w2r2 ⇒. . . ⇒w1w2 . . . wnrn ⇒w1w2 . . . wn = w.
This proves that w ∈L(G).
The proof of the claim that L(G) ⊆L is left as an exercise.
In Sections 2.9.1 and 3.2.2, we have seen that the language {0n1n : n ≥
0} is not regular, but context-free. Therefore, the class of all context-free
languages properly contains the class of regular languages.
3.3.1
An example
Let L be the language deﬁned as
L = {w ∈{0, 1}∗: 101 is a substring of w}.
In Section 2.2.2, we have seen that L is a regular language. In that section,
we constructed the following deterministic ﬁnite automaton M that accepts
L (we have renamed the states):
0
1
1
0
0
1
0,1
S
A
B
C
We apply the construction given in the proof of Theorem 3.3.1 to convert
M to a context-free grammar G whose language is equal to L. According
to this construction, we have G = (V, Σ, R, S), where V = {S, A, B, C},
Σ = {0, 1}, the start variable S is the start state of M, and R consists of the
rules
