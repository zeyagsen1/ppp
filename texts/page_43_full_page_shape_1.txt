 You will notice three di erences with the nite automata that we have
 seen until now. First, if the automaton is in state q1 and reads the symbol 1,
 then it has two options: Either it stays in state q1, or it switches to state q2.
 Second, if the automaton is in state q2, then it can switch to state q3 without
 reading a symbol; this is indicated by the edge having the empty string as
 label. Third, if the automaton is in state q3 and reads the symbol 0, then it
 cannot continue.
 Let us see what this automaton can do when it gets the string 010110 as
 input. Initially, the automaton is in the start state q1.
 Since the rst symbol in the input string is 0, the automaton stays in
 state q1 after having read this symbol.
 The second symbol is 1, and the automaton can either stay in state q1
 or switch to state q2.If the automaton stays in state q1, then it is still in this state after
 having read the third symbol.
 If the automaton switches to state q2, then it again has two op
tions:
 Either read the third symbol in the input string, which is 0,
 and switch to state q3,
 or switch to state q3, without reading the third symbol.
 If we continue in this way, then we see that, for the input string 010110,
 there are seven possible computations. All these computations are given in
 the gure below.
