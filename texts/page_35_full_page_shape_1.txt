 Let
 A= w: wisabinary string containing an odd number of 1s
 We claim that this language A is regular. In order to prove this, we have to
 construct a nite automaton M such that A = L(M).
 How to construct M? Here is a rst idea: The nite automaton reads the
 input string w from left to right and keeps track of the number of 1s it has
 seen. After having read the entire string w, it checks whether this number
 is odd (in which case w is accepted) or even (in which case w is rejected).
 Using this approach, the nite automaton needs a state for every integer
 i 
0, indicating that the number of 1s read so far is equal to i. Hence,
 to design a nite automaton that follows this approach, we need an innite
 number of states. But, the de nition of nite automaton requires the number
 of states to be nite.
 A better, and correct approach, is to keep track of whether the number
 of 1s read so far is even or odd. This leads to the following nite automaton:
 The set of states is Q = qe qo . If the nite automaton is in state qe,
 then it has read an even number of 1s; if it is in state qo, then it has
 read an odd number of 1s.
 The alphabet is = 01 .
 The start state is qe, because at the start, the number of 1s read by the
 automaton is equal to 0, and 0 is even.
 The set F of accept states is F = qo .
 The transition function is given by the following table:

 This ﬁnite automaton M = (Q, Σ, δ, qe, F) can also be described by its state
diagram, which is given in the ﬁgure below. The arrow that comes “out of
the blue” and enters the state qe, indicates that qe is the start state. The
state depicted with double circles indicates the accept state.We have constructed a ﬁnite automaton M that accepts the language A.
Therefore, A is a regular language.
