Let A be the language
A = {w ∈{0, 1}∗: w has a 1 in the third position from the right},
where {0, 1}∗is the set of all binary strings, including the empty string ϵ. We
claim that A is a regular language. To prove this, we have to construct a ﬁnite
automaton M such that A = L(M). At ﬁrst sight, it seems diﬃcult (or even
impossible?) to construct such a ﬁnite automaton: How does the automaton
“know” that it has reached the third symbol from the right? It is, however,
possible to construct such an automaton. The main idea is to remember the
last three symbols that have been read. Thus, the ﬁnite automaton has eight
states qijk, where i, j, and k range over the two elements of {0, 1}. If the
automaton is in state qijk, then the following hold:
• If M has read at least three symbols, then the three most recently read
symbols are ijk.
• If M has read only two symbols, then these two symbols are jk; more-
over, i = 0.
• If M has read only one symbol, then this symbol is k; moreover, i =
j = 0.
• If M has not read any symbol, then i = j = k = 0.
The start state is q000 and the set of accept states is {q100, q110, q101, q111}.
The transition function of M is given by the following state diagram.
