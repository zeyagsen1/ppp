 We say that q1 is the start state and q2 is an accept state. Consider the
 input string 1101. This string is processed in the following way:
 Initially, the machine is in the start state q1.
 After having read the rst 1, the machine switches from state q1 to
 state q2.
 After having read the second 1, the machine switches from state q2 to
 state q2. (So actually, it does not switch.)
 After having read the rst 0, the machine switches from state q2 to
 state q3.
 After having read the third 1, the machine switches from state q3 to
 state q2.
 After the entire string 1101 has been processed, the machine is in state q2,
 which is an accept state. We say that the string 1101 is accepted by the
 machine.
 Consider now the input string 0101010. After having read this string
 from left to right (starting in the start state q1), the machine is in state q3.
 Since q3 is not an accept state, we say that the machine rejects the string
 0101010.
 Wehope you are able to see that this machine accepts every binary string
 that ends with a 1. In fact, the machine accepts more strings:
 Every binary string having the property that there are an even number
 of 0s following the rightmost 1, is accepted by this machine.
Every other binary string is rejected by the machine. Observe that each
 such string is either empty, consists of 0s only, or has an odd number
 of 0s following the rightmost 1.
 We now come to the formal de nition of a nite automaton:
