Deﬁne the language A as
A = {w : w is a binary string containing 101 as a substring}.
Again, we claim that A is a regular language. In other words, we claim that
there exists a ﬁnite automaton M that accepts A, i.e., A = L(M).
The ﬁnite automaton M will do the following, when reading an input
string from left to right:
• It skips over all 0s, and stays in the start state.
• At the ﬁrst 1, it switches to the state “maybe the next two symbols are
01”.
– If the next symbol is 1, then it stays in the state “maybe the next
two symbols are 01”.
– On the other hand, if the next symbol is 0, then it switches to the
state “maybe the next symbol is 1”.
∗If the next symbol is indeed 1, then it switches to the accept
state (but keeps on reading until the end of the string).
∗On the other hand, if the next symbol is 0, then it switches
to the start state, and skips 0s until it reads 1 again.
By deﬁning the following four states, this process will become clear:
• q1: M is in this state if the last symbol read was 1, but the substring
101 has not been read.
• q10: M is in this state if the last two symbols read were 10, but the
substring 101 has not been read.
• q101: M is in this state if the substring 101 has been read in the input
string.
• q: In all other cases, M is in this state.
Here is the formal description of the ﬁnite automaton that accepts the
language A:
• Q = {q, q1, q10, q101},
• Σ = {0, 1},
• the start state is q,
• the set F of accept states is equal to F = {q101}, and
• the transition function δ is given by the following table:
The ﬁgure below gives the state diagram of the ﬁnite automaton M =
This nite automaton accepts the language A consisting of all binary
 strings that contain the substring 101. As an exercise, how would you obtain
 a nite automaton that accepts the complement of A, i.e., the language
 consisting of all binary strings that do not contain the substring 101?
