Rice’s Theorem

Algorithm D:
On input ⟨Pn⟩, where n is a positive integer, the
new Java program D does the following:
Step 1: Run the Java program H on the input ⟨Pn, ⟨Pn⟩⟩.
Step 2:
• If H returns true, then D goes into an inﬁnite loop.
• If H returns false, then D returns true and terminates its com-
putation.
Observe that D can be written as a Java program. Therefore, there exists
an integer n ≥1 such that D = Pn. The next two observations follow from
the pseudocode:
• If D terminates on input ⟨Pn⟩, then H returns false on input ⟨Pn, ⟨Pn⟩⟩,
i.e., Pn does not terminate on input ⟨Pn⟩.
• If D does not terminate on input ⟨Pn⟩, then H returns true on input
⟨Pn, ⟨Pn⟩⟩, i.e., Pn terminates on input ⟨Pn⟩.
Thus,
• D terminates on input ⟨Pn⟩if and only if Pn does not terminate on
input ⟨Pn⟩.
Since D = Pn, this becomes
• D terminates on input ⟨D⟩if and only if D does not terminate on input
⟨D⟩.
Thus, we have obtained a contradiction.
Remark 5.2.6 We deﬁned the Java program D in such a way that, for each
n ≥1, the computation of D on input ⟨Pn⟩diﬀers from the computation of
Pn on input ⟨Pn⟩. Hence, for each n ≥1, D ̸= Pn. However, since D is a
Java program, there must be an integer n ≥1 such that D = Pn.
