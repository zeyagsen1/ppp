2. Determine all equivalence classes of the relation RL.
2.28 Let Σ be a non-empty alphabet, and let L be a language over Σ, i.e.,
L ⊆Σ∗. Recall the equivalence relation RL that was deﬁned in Exercise 2.26.
1. Assume that L is a regular language, and let M = (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F) be
a DFA that accepts L. Let u and u′ be strings in Σ∗. Let q be the
state reached, when following the path in the state diagram of M, that
starts in q0 and that is obtained by reading the string u. Similarly, let
q′ be the state reached, when following the path in the state diagram
of M, that starts in q0 and that is obtained by reading the string u′.
Prove the following: If q = q′, then uRLu′.
2. Prove the following claim: If L is a regular language, then the equiva-
lence relation RL has a ﬁnite number of equivalence classes.
2.29 Let L be the language deﬁned by
L = {uuR : u ∈{0, 1}∗}.
In words, a string is in L if and only if its length is even, and the second half
is the reverse of the ﬁrst half. Consider the equivalence relation RL that was
deﬁned in Exercise 2.26.
1. Let m and n be two distinct positive integers and consider the two
strings u = 0m1 and u′ = 0n1. Prove that ¬(uRLu′).
2. Prove that L is not a regular language, without using the pumping
lemma.
3. Use the pumping lemma to prove that L is not a regular language.
2.30 In this exercise, we will show that the converse of the pumping lemma
does, in general, not hold. Consider the language
A = {ambncn : m ≥1, n ≥0} ∪{bnck : n ≥0, k ≥0}.
1. Show that A satisﬁes the conclusion of the pumping lemma for p = 1.
Thus, show that every string s in A whose length is at least p can be
written as s = xyz, such that y ̸= ϵ, |xy| ≤p, and xyiz ∈A for all
i ≥0.
