Introduction
Theorem 1.3.5 For every even integer n ≥4, there exists a 3-regular graph
with n vertices.
Proof. Deﬁne
V = {0, 1, 2, . . . , n −1},
and
E = {{i, i+1} : 0 ≤i ≤n−2}∪{{n−1, 0}}∪{{i, i+n/2} : 0 ≤i ≤n/2−1}.
Then the graph G = (V, E) is 3-regular.
Convince yourself that this graph is indeed 3-regular. It may help to draw
the graph for, say, n = 8.

Nonconstructive proofs
In a nonconstructive proof, we show that a certain object exists, without
actually creating it. Here is an example of such a proof:
Theorem 1.3.6 There exist irrational numbers x and y such that xy is ra-
tional.
Proof. There are two possible cases.
Case 1:
√
2
√
2 ∈Q.
In this case, we take x = y =
√
2. In Theorem 1.3.9 below, we will prove
that
√
2 is irrational.
Case 2:
√
2
√
2 ̸∈Q.
In this case, we take x =
√
2
√
2 and y =
√
2. Since
xy =
√
2
√
2√
2
=
√
2
2 = 2,
the claim in the theorem follows.
Observe that this proof indeed proves the theorem, but it does not give
an example of a pair of irrational numbers x and y such that xy is rational.
