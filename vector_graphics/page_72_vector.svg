Chapter 2.
Finite Automata and Regular Languages
Let M = (Q, Σ, δ, q, F) be an arbitrary deterministic ﬁnite automaton.
We will show that there exists a regular expression that describes the lan-
guage L(M).
For each state r ∈Q, we deﬁne
Lr = {w ∈Σ∗:
the path in the state diagram of M that starts
in state r and that corresponds to w ends in a
state of F }.
In words, Lr is the language accepted by M, if r were the start state.
We will show that each such language Lr can be described by a regular
expression. Since L(M) = Lq, this will prove that L(M) can be described by
a regular expression.
The basic idea is to set up equations for the languages Lr, which we then
solve using Lemma 2.8.2. We claim that
Lr =
[
a∈Σ
a · Lδ(r,a)
if r ̸∈F.
(2.2)
Why is this true? Let w be a string in Lr. Then the path P in the state
diagram of M that starts in state r and that corresponds to w ends in a
state of F. Since r ̸∈F, this path contains at least one edge. Let r′ be the
state that follows the ﬁrst state (i.e., r) of P. Then r′ = δ(r, b) for some
symbol b ∈Σ. Hence, b is the ﬁrst symbol of w. Write w = bv, where v is
the remaining part of w. Then the path P ′ = P \ {r} in the state diagram
of M that starts in state r′ and that corresponds to v ends in a state of F.
Therefore, v ∈Lr′ = Lδ(r,b). Hence,
w ∈b · Lδ(r,b) ⊆
[
a∈Σ
a · Lδ(r,a).
Conversely, let w be a string in S
a∈Σ a · Lδ(r,a). Then there is a symbol b ∈Σ
and a string v ∈Lδ(r,b) such that w = bv. Let P ′ be the path in the state
diagram of M that starts in state δ(r, b) and that corresponds to v. Since
v ∈Lδ(r,b), this path ends in a state of F. Let P be the path in the state
diagram of M that starts in r, follows the edge to δ(r, b), and then follows P ′.
This path P corresponds to w and ends in a state of F. Therefore, w ∈Lr.
This proves the correctness of (2.2).
