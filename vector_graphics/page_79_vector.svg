The pumping lemma and nonregular languages

Second example
Consider the language
A = {w ∈{0, 1}∗: the number of 0s in w equals the number of 1s in w}.
Again, we prove by contradiction that A is not a regular language.
Assume that A is a regular language. Let p ≥1 be the pumping length,
as given by the pumping lemma. Consider the string s = 0p1p. Then s ∈A
and |s| = 2p ≥p. By the pumping lemma, s can be written as s = xyz,
where y ̸= ϵ, |xy| ≤p, and xyiz ∈A for all i ≥0.
Since |xy| ≤p, the string y contains only 0s. Since y ̸= ϵ, y contains at
least one 0. Therefore, the string xy2z = xyyz contains more 0s than 1s,
which implies that this string is not contained in A. But, by the pumping
lemma, this string is contained in A. This is a contradiction and, therefore,
A is not a regular language.
Third example
Consider the language
A = {ww : w ∈{0, 1}∗}.
We prove by contradiction that A is not a regular language.
Assume that A is a regular language. Let p ≥1 be the pumping length,
as given by the pumping lemma. Consider the string s = 0p10p1. Then s ∈A
and |s| = 2p + 2 ≥p. By the pumping lemma, s can be written as s = xyz,
where y ̸= ϵ, |xy| ≤p, and xyiz ∈A for all i ≥0.
Since |xy| ≤p, the string y contains only 0s. Since y ̸= ϵ, y contains at
least one 0. Therefore, the string xy2z = xyyz is not contained in A. But,
by the pumping lemma, this string is contained in A. This is a contradiction
and, therefore, A is not a regular language.
You should convince yourself that by choosing s = 02p (which is a string
in A whose length is at least p), we do not obtain a contradiction. The reason
is that the string y may have an even length. Thus, 02p is the “wrong” string
for showing that A is not regular. By choosing s = 0p10p1, we do obtain
a contradiction; thus, this is the “correct” string for showing that A is not
regular.
