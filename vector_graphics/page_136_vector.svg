Context-Free Languages
Finally, we show that the ﬁrst property in the pumping lemma holds.
That is, we prove that |vy| ≥1. Recall that
Aj
∗⇒vAky.
Let the ﬁrst rule used in this derivation be Aj →BC. (Since the variables
Aj and Ak, even though they are equal, are stored at diﬀerent nodes of the
parse tree, and since the grammar G is in Chomsky normal form, this ﬁrst
rule exists.) Then
Aj ⇒BC
∗⇒vAky.
Observe that the string BC has length two. Moreover, by applying rules of
a grammar in Chomsky normal form, strings cannot become shorter. (Here,
we use the fact that the start variable does not occur on the right-hand side
of any rule.) Therefore, we have |vAky| ≥2. But this implies that |vy| ≥1.
This completes the proof of the pumping lemma.
3.8.2
Applications of the pumping lemma
First example
Consider the language
A = {anbncn : n ≥0}.
We will prove by contradiction that A is not a context-free language.
Assume that A is a context-free language. Let p ≥1 be the pumping
length, as given by the pumping lemma. Consider the string s = apbpcp.
Observe that s ∈A and |s| = 3p ≥p. Hence, by the pumping lemma, s can
be written as s = uvxyz, where |vy| ≥1, |vxy| ≤p, and uvixyiz ∈A for all
i ≥0.
Observe that the pumping lemma does not tell us the location of the
substring vxy in the string s, it only gives us an upper bound on the length
of this substring. Therefore, we have to consider three cases, depending on
the location of vxy in s.
Case 1: The substring vxy does not contain any c.
Consider the string uv2xy2z = uvvxyyz.
Since |vy| ≥1, this string
contains more than p many as or more than p many bs. Since it contains
exactly p many cs, it follows that this string is not in the language A. This
is a contradiction because, by the pumping lemma, the string uv2xy2z is in
A.
