Figure 6.4: The formula ϕ in (6.7) is mapped to this graph. The vertices on
the top represent C1; the vertices on the left represent C2; the vertices on
the right represent C3.
To prove this, we ﬁrst assume that the formula
ϕ = C1 ∧C2 ∧. . . ∧Ck
is satisﬁable. Then there exists a truth-value in {0, 1} for each of the variables
x1, x2, . . . , xm, such that the entire formula ϕ is true. Hence, for each i with
1 ≤i ≤k, there is at least one term ℓi
a in
Ci = ℓi
1 ∨ℓi

that is true (i.e., has value 1).
Let V ′ be the set of vertices obtained by choosing for each i, 1 ≤i ≤k,
exactly one vertex vi
a such that ℓi
a has value 1.
It is clear that V ′ contains exactly k vertices. We claim that this set is
a clique in G. To prove this claim, let vi
a and vj
b be two distinct vertices in
V ′. It follows from the deﬁnition of V ′ that i ̸= j and ℓi
a = ℓj
b = 1. Hence,
ℓi
a is not the negation of ℓj
b. But this means that the vertices vi
a and vj
b are
connected by an edge in G.
This proves one direction of (6.8). To prove the other direction, we assume
that the graph G contains a clique V ′ with k vertices.
