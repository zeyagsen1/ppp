The transition function δ is speciﬁed by the following instructions:
q0a2 →q0aaRR
q1aa →q1aaLN
q0b2 →q0bbRR
q1ab →q1abLN
q022 →q122LL
q1ba →q1baLN
q1bb →q1bbLN
q12a →q22aRN
q12b →q22bRN
q122 →qaccept
q2aa →q2aaRL
q2ab →qreject
q2ba →qreject
q2bb →q2bbRL
q222 →qaccept
Again, you should run this Turing machine for some sample inputs.
4.2.3
Accepting anbncn using one tape
We will construct1 a Turing machine with one tape that accepts the language
{anbncn : n ≥0}.
Recall that we have proved in Section 3.8.2 that this language is not context-
free.
Start of the computation: The tape contains the input string w and the
tape head is on the leftmost symbol of w. The Turing machine is in the start
state.
Idea: In the previous examples, the tape alphabet Γ was equal to the union
of the input alphabet Σ and {2}. In this example, we will add one symbol
d to the tape alphabet. As we will see, this simpliﬁes the construction of
the Turing machine. Thus, the input alphabet is Σ = {a, b, c} and the tape
alphabet is Γ = {a, b, c, d, 2}. Recall that the input string w belongs to Σ∗.
The general approach is to split the computation into two stages.
1Thanks to Michael Fleming for pointing out an error in a previous version of this
construction.
