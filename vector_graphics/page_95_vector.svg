2. For any string w = w1w2 . . . wn, we denote by wR the string obtained
by reading w backwards, i.e., wR = wnwn−1 . . . w2w1. For any language
A, we deﬁne AR to be the language obtained by reading all strings in
A backwards, i.e.,
AR = {wR : w ∈A}.
Let A be a non-empty regular language. Prove that the language AR
is also regular.
2.19 If n ≥1 is an integer and w = a1a2 . . . an is a string, then for any i
with 0 ≤i < n, the string a1a2 . . . ai is called a proper preﬁx of w. (If i = 0,
then a1a2 . . . ai = ϵ.)
For any language L, we deﬁne MIN(L) to be the language
MIN(L) = {w ∈L : no proper preﬁx of w belongs to L}.
Prove the following claim: If L is a regular language, then MIN(L) is regular
as well.
2.20 Use the pumping lemma to prove that the following languages are not
regular.
1. {anbmcn+m : n ≥0, m ≥0}.
2. {anbnc2n : n ≥0}.
3. {anbman : n ≥0, m ≥0}.
4. {a2n : n ≥0}. (Remark: a2n is the string consisting of 2n many a’s.)
5. {anbmck : n ≥0, m ≥0, k ≥0, n2 + m2 = k2}.
6. {uvu : u ∈{a, b}∗, u ̸= ϵ, v ∈{a, b}∗}.
2.21 Prove that the language
{ambn : m ≥0, n ≥0, m ̸= n}
is not regular. (Using the pumping lemma for this one is a bit tricky. You
can avoid using the pumping lemma by combining results about the closure
under regular operations.)
