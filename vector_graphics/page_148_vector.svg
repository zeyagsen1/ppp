Turing Machines and the Church-Turing Thesis
• the Turing machine switches to state r′,
• the head of the i-th tape replaces the scanned symbol ai by the symbol
a′
i, 1 ≤i ≤k, and
• the head of the i-th tape moves according to σi, 1 ≤i ≤k: if σi = L,
then the tape head moves one cell to the left; if σi = R, then it moves
one cell to the right; if σi = N, then the tape head does not move.
We will write the computation step (4.1) in the form of the instruction

kσ1σ2 . . . σk.
We now specify the computation of the Turing machine
M = (Σ, Γ, Q, δ, q, qaccept, qreject).
Start conﬁguration: The input is a string over the input alphabet Σ.
Initially, this input string is stored on the ﬁrst tape, and the head of this
tape is on the leftmost symbol of the input string. Initially, all other k −1
tapes are empty, i.e., only contain blank symbols, and the Turing machine is
in the start state q.
Computation and termination: Starting in the start conﬁguration, the
Turing machine performs a sequence of computation steps as described above.
The computation terminates at the moment when the Turing machine en-
ters the accept state qaccept or the reject state qreject. (Hence, if the Turing
machine never enters the states qaccept and qreject, the computation does not
terminate.)
Acceptance: The Turing machine M accepts the input string w ∈Σ∗, if the
computation on this input terminates in the state qaccept. If the computation
on this input terminates in the state qreject, then M rejects the input string
w.
We denote by L(M) the language accepted by the Turing machine M.
Thus, L(M) is the set of all strings in Σ∗that are accepted by M.
Observe that a string w ∈Σ∗does not belong to L(M) if and only if on
input w,
• the computation of M terminates in the state qreject or
• the computation of M does not terminate.
