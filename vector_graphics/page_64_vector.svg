Finite Automata and Regular Languages
• The regular expression 1∗∅describes the empty language, i.e., the lan-
guage ∅. (You should convince yourself that this is correct.)
• The regular expression ∅∗describes the language {ϵ}.
Deﬁnition 2.7.3 Let R1 and R2 be regular expressions and let L1 and L2
be the languages described by them, respectively. If L1 = L2 (i.e., R1 and
R2 describe the same language), then we will write R1 = R2.
Hence, even though (0∪ϵ)1∗and 01∗∪1∗are diﬀerent regular expressions,
we write
(0 ∪ϵ)1∗= 01∗∪1∗,
because they describe the same language.
In Section 2.8.2, we will show that every regular language can be described
by a regular expression. The proof of this fact is purely algebraic and uses
the following algebraic identities involving regular expressions.
Theorem 2.7.4 Let R1, R2, and R3 be regular expressions. The following
identities hold:
1. R1∅= ∅R1 = ∅.
2. R1ϵ = ϵR1 = R1.
3. R1 ∪∅= ∅∪R1 = R1.
4. R1 ∪R1 = R1.
5. R1 ∪R2 = R2 ∪R1.
6. R1(R2 ∪R3) = R1R2 ∪R1R3.
7. (R1 ∪R2)R3 = R1R3 ∪R2R3.
8. R1(R2R3) = (R1R2)R3.
9. ∅∗= ϵ.
10. ϵ∗= ϵ.
11. (ϵ ∪R1)∗= R∗
