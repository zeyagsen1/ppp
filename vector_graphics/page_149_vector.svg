Accepting palindromes using one tape
We will show how to construct a Turing machine with one tape, that decides
whether or not any input string w ∈{a, b}∗is a palindrome. Recall that the
string w is called a palindrome, if reading w from left to right gives the same
result as reading w from right to left. Examples of palindromes are abba,
baabbbbaab, and the empty string ϵ.
Start of the computation: The tape contains the input string w, the tape
head is on the leftmost symbol of w, and the Turing machine is in the start
state q0.
Idea: The tape head reads the leftmost symbol of w, deletes this symbol
and “remembers” it by means of a state.
Then the tape head moves to
the rightmost symbol and tests whether it is equal to the (already deleted)
leftmost symbol.
• If they are equal, then the rightmost symbol is deleted, the tape head
moves to the new leftmost symbol, and the whole process is repeated.
• If they are not equal, the Turing machine enters the reject state, and
the computation terminates.
The Turing machine enters the accept state as soon as the string currently
stored on the tape is empty.
We will use the input alphabet Σ = {a, b} and the tape alphabet Γ =
{a, b, 2}. The set Q of states consists of the following eight states:
q0 :
start state; tape head is on the leftmost symbol
qa :
leftmost symbol was a; tape head is moving to the right
qb :
leftmost symbol was b; tape head is moving to the right
q′
a :
reached rightmost symbol; test whether it is equal to a, and delete it
q′
b :
reached rightmost symbol; test whether it is equal to b, and delete it
qL :
test was positive; tape head is moving to the left
qaccept :
accept state
qreject :
reject state
