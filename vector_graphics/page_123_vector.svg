Examples of pushdown automata
115
Start conﬁguration: Initially, the pushdown automaton is in the start state
q, the tape head is on the leftmost symbol of the input string a1a2 . . . an, and
the stack only contains the special symbol $.
Computation and termination: Starting in the start conﬁguration, the
pushdown automaton performs a sequence of computation steps as described
above. It terminates at the moment when the stack becomes empty. (Hence,
if the stack never gets empty, the pushdown automaton does not terminate.)
Acceptance: The pushdown automaton accepts the input string a1a2 . . . an ∈
Σ∗, if
1. the automaton terminates on this input, and
2. at the time of termination (i.e., at the moment when the stack gets
empty), the tape head is on the cell immediately to the right of the cell
containing the symbol an (this cell must contain the blank symbol 2).
In all other cases, the pushdown automaton rejects the input string. Thus,
the pushdown automaton rejects this string if
1. the automaton does not terminate on this input (i.e., the computation
“loops forever”) or
2. at the time of termination, the tape head is not on the cell immediately
to the right of the cell containing the symbol an.
We denote by L(M) the language accepted by the pushdown automaton
M. Thus,
L(M) = {w ∈Σ∗: M accepts w}.
The pushdown automaton described above is deterministic. For a non-
deterministic pushdown automata, the current computation step may not
be uniquely deﬁned, but the automaton can make a choice out of a ﬁnite
number of possibilities. In this case, the transition function δ is a function
δ : Q × (Σ ∪{2}) × Γ →Pf(Q × {N, R} × Γ∗),
where Pf(K) is the set of all ﬁnite subsets of the set K.
We say that a nondeterministic pushdown automaton M accepts an input
string, if there exists an accepting computation, in the sense as described for
deterministic pushdown automata. We say that M rejects an input string, if
every computation on this string is rejecting. As before, we denote by L(M)
the set of all strings in Σ∗that are accepted by M.
