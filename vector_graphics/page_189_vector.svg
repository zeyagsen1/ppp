5.6.
Most languages are not enumerable

Why is the set S countable? For each integer n ≥0, there are exactly 2n
binary strings of length n. Since there are binary strings that are not encod-
ings of Turing machines, the set S contains at most 2n strings of length n.
In particular, the number of strings in S having length n is ﬁnite. Therefore,
we obtain an inﬁnite list of the elements of S in the following way:
• List all strings in S having length 0. (Well, the empty string is not in
S, so in this step, nothing happens.)
• List all strings in S having length 1.
• List all strings in S having length 2.
• List all strings in S having length 3.
• Etcetera, etcetera.
In this inﬁnite list, every element of S occurs exactly once. Therefore, S is
countable.
5.6.2
The set of all languages is not countable
We deﬁne the set L as
L = {A : A ⊆{0, 1}∗is a language}.
In words, L is the set consisting of all languages. Every element of the set L
is a set consisting of strings.
Lemma 5.6.2 The set L is not countable.
Proof. We deﬁne the set B as
B = {w : w is an inﬁnite binary sequence}.
We claim that this set is not countable. The proof of this claim is almost
identical to the proof of Theorem 5.2.4. We assume that the set B is count-
able. Then there exists a bijection f : N →B. Thus, for each n ∈N, f(n) is
an inﬁnite binary sequence. We can write
B = {f(1), f(2), f(3), . . .},
