Theorem 5.2.4 The set R of real numbers is not countable.
Proof. Deﬁne
A = {x ∈R : 0 ≤x < 1}.
We will prove that the set A is not countable. This will imply that the set
R is not countable, because A ⊆R.
The proof that A is not countable is by contradiction. So we assume that
A is countable. Then there exists a bijection f : N →A. Thus, for each
n ∈N, f(n) is a real number between zero and one. We can write
A = {f(1), f(2), f(3), . . .},
(5.2)
where every element of A occurs exactly once in the set on the right-hand
side.
Consider the real number f(1). We can write this number in decimal
notation as
f(1) = 0.d11d12d13 . . . ,
where each d1i is a digit in the set {0, 1, 2, . . . , 9}. In general, for every n ∈N,
we can write the real number f(n) as
f(n) = 0.dn1dn2dn3 . . . ,
where, again, each dni is a digit in {0, 1, 2, . . . , 9}.
We deﬁne the real number
x = 0.d1d2d3 . . . ,
where, for each integer n ≥1,
dn =
 4
if dnn ̸= 4,
5
if dnn = 4.
Observe that x is a real number between zero and one, i.e., x ∈A. Therefore,
by (5.2), there is an element n ∈N, such that f(n) = x. We compare the
n-th digits of f(n) and x:
• The n-th digit of f(n) is equal to dnn.
• The n-th digit of x is equal to dn.
