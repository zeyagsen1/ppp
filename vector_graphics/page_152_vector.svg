Turing Machines and the Church-Turing Thesis
Stage 1: In this stage, we check if the string w is in the language described
by the regular expression a∗b∗c∗. If this is the case, then we walk back to
the leftmost symbol. For this stage, we use the following states, besides the
states qaccept and qreject:
qa :
start state; we are reading the block of a’s
qb :
we are reading the block of b’s
qc :
we are reading the block of c’s
qL :
walk to the leftmost symbol
Stage 2: In this stage, we repeat the following: Walk along the string from
left to right, replace the leftmost a by d, replace the leftmost b by d, replace
the leftmost c by d, and walk back to the leftmost symbol.
For this stage, we use the following states:
q′
a :
start state of Stage 2; search for the leftmost a
q′
b :
leftmost a has been replaced by d;
search for the leftmost b
q′
c :
leftmost a has been replaced by d;
leftmost b has been replaced by d;
search for the leftmost c
q′
L :
leftmost a has been replaced by d;
leftmost b has been replaced by d;
leftmost c has been replaced by d;
walk to the leftmost symbol
The transition function δ is speciﬁed by the following instructions:
qaa →qaaR
qba →qreject
qab →qbbR
qbb →qbbR
qac →qccR
qbc →qccR
qad →cannot happen
qbd →cannot happen
qa2 →qL2L
qb2 →qL2L
qca →qreject
qLa →qLaL
qcb →qreject
qLb →qLbL
qcc →qccR
qLc →qLcL
qcd →cannot happen
qLd →cannot happen
qc2 →qL2L
qL2 →q′
