4.1.
Deﬁnition of a Turing machine
139
(c) each tape head either moves one cell to the left, moves one cell to
the right, or stays at the current cell.
We now give a formal deﬁnition of a deterministic Turing machine.
Deﬁnition 4.1.1 A deterministic Turing machine is a 7-tuple
M = (Σ, Γ, Q, δ, q, qaccept, qreject),
where
1. Σ is a ﬁnite set, called the input alphabet; the blank symbol 2 is not
contained in Σ,
2. Γ is a ﬁnite set, called the tape alphabet; this alphabet contains the
blank symbol 2, and Σ ⊆Γ,
3. Q is a ﬁnite set, whose elements are called states,
4. q is an element of Q; it is called the start state,
5. qaccept is an element of Q; it is called the accept state,
6. qreject is an element of Q; it is called the reject state,
7. δ is called the transition function, which is a function
δ : Q × Γk →Q × Γk × {L, R, N}k.
The transition function δ is basically the “program” of the Turing ma-
chine. This function tells us what the machine can do in “one computation
step”: Let r ∈Q, and let a1, a2, . . . , ak ∈Γ.
Furthermore, let r′ ∈Q,
a′
1, a′
2, . . . , a′
k ∈Γ, and σ1, σ2, . . . , σk ∈{L, R, N} be such that
δ(r, a1, a2, . . . , ak) = (r′, a′
1, a′
2, . . . , a′
k, σ1, σ2, . . . , σk).
(4.1)
This transition means that if
• the Turing machine is in state r, and
• the head of the i-th tape reads the symbol ai, 1 ≤i ≤k,
then
