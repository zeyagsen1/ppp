Turing Machines and the Church-Turing Thesis
4.5 Construct a Turing machine with two tapes that receives as input two
non-negative integers x and y, and returns as output the integer x + y.
Integers are represented as binary strings.
Start of the computation: The ﬁrst tape contains the binary represen-
tation of x and its head is on the rightmost symbol of x. The second tape
contains the binary representation of y and its head is on the rightmost bit
of y. At the start, the Turing machine is in the start state q0.
End of the computation: The ﬁrst tape contains the binary representation
of x and its head is on the rightmost symbol of x. The second tape contains
the binary representation of the integer x + y (thus, the integer y is “gone”).
The head of the second tape is on the rightmost bit of x + y. The Turing
machine is in the ﬁnal state q1.
4.6 Give an informal description (in plain English) of a Turing machine with
one tape that receives as input two non-negative integers x and y, and returns
as output the integer x+y. Integers are represented as binary strings. If you
are an adventurous student, you may give a formal deﬁnition of your Turing
machine.
4.7 Construct a Turing machine with one tape that receives as input an
integer x ≥1 and returns as output the integer x−1. Integers are represented
in binary.
Start of the computation: The tape contains the binary representation of
the input x. The tape head is on the rightmost symbol of x and the Turing
machine is in the start state q0.
End of the computation: The tape contains the binary representation of
the integer x −1. The tape head is on the rightmost bit of x −1 and the
Turing machine is in the ﬁnal state q1.
4.8 Give an informal description (in plain English) of a Turing machine with
three tapes that receives as input two non-negative integers x and y, and
returns as output the integer xy. Integers are represented as binary strings.
Start of the computation: The ﬁrst tape contains the binary represen-
tation of x and its head is on the rightmost symbol of x. The second tape
contains the binary representation of y and its head is on the rightmost sym-
bol of y. The third tape is empty and its head is at an arbitrary location.
The Turing machine is in the start state q0.
