The pumping lemma for context-free languages
129
Case 2: The substring vxy does not contain any a.
Consider the string uv2xy2z = uvvxyyz.
Since |vy| ≥1, this string
contains more than p many bs or more than p many cs. Since it contains
exactly p many as, it follows that this string is not in the language A. This
is a contradiction because, by the pumping lemma, the string uv2xy2z is in
A.
Case 3: The substring vxy contains at least one a and at least one c.
Since s = apbpcp, this implies that |vxy| > p, which again contradicts the
pumping lemma.
Thus, in all of the three cases, we have obtained a contradiction. There-
fore, we have shown that the language A is not context-free.
Second example
Consider the languages
A = {wwR : w ∈{a, b}∗},
where wR is the string obtained by writing w backwards, and
B = {ww : w ∈{a, b}∗}.
Even though these languages look similar, we will show that A is context-free
and B is not context-free.
Consider the following context-free grammar, in which S is the start vari-
able:
S →ϵ|aSa|bSb.
It is easy to see that the language of this grammar is exactly the language A.
Therefore, A is context-free. Alternatively, we can show that A is context-
free, by constructing a (nondeterministic) pushdown automaton that accepts
A. This automaton has two states q and q′, where q is the start state. If the
automaton is in state q, then it did not yet ﬁnish reading the leftmost half of
the input string; it pushes all symbols read onto the stack. If the automaton
is in state q′, then it is reading the rightmost half of the input string; for each
symbol read, it checks whether it is equal to the symbol on top of the stack
and, if so, pops the top symbol from the stack. The pushdown automaton
uses nondeterminism to “guess” when to switch from state q to state q′ (i.e.,
when it has completed reading the leftmost half of the input string).
