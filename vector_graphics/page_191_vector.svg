The function g deﬁned above has the following properties:
• If A and A′ are two diﬀerent languages in L, then g(A) ̸= g(A′).
• For every inﬁnite binary sequence w in B, there exists a language A in
L, such that g(A) = w.
This means that the function g is a bijection from L to B.
5.6.3
There are languages that are not enumerable
We have proved that the set
E = {A : A ⊆{0, 1}∗is an enumerable language}
is countable, whereas the set
L = {A : A ⊆{0, 1}∗is a language}
is not countable. This means that there are “more” languages in L than
there are in E, proving the following result:
