Time tables
We are given a set of courses, class rooms, and professors.
We want to
decide whether or not there exists a time table such that all courses are
being taught, no two courses are taught at the same time in the same class
room, no professor teaches two courses at the same time, and conditions such
as “Prof. L. Azy does not teach before 1pm” are satisﬁed. This problem is
NP-complete.
Motion planning
We are given two positive integers k and ℓ, a set of k polyhedra, and two
points s and t in Q3. We want to decide whether or not there exists a path
between s and t, that does not intersect any of the polyhedra, and whose
length is less than or equal to ℓ. This problem is NP-complete.
Map labeling
We are given a map with m cities, where each city is represented by a point.
For each city, we are given a rectangle that is large enough to contain the
name of the city. We want to decide whether or not these rectangles can be
placed on the map, such that
• no two rectangles overlap,
• For each i with 1 ≤i ≤m, the point that represents city i is a corner
of its rectangle.
This problem is NP-complete.
This list of NP-complete problems can be extended almost arbitrarily:
For thousands of problems, it is known that they are NP-complete. For all
of these, it is not known, whether or not they can be solved eﬃciently (i.e.,
in polynomial time). Collections of NP-complete problems can be found in
the book
