Chapter 7.
Summary
We have seen that the class of regular languages is closed under the regular
operations: If A and B are regular languages, then
1. A ∪B is regular,
2. AB is regular,
3. A∗is regular,
4. A is regular, and
5. A ∩B is regular.
Finally, the pumping lemma for regular languages gives a property that
every regular language possesses. We have used this to prove that languages
such as {anbn : n ≥0} are not regular.
Context-free languages:
This class of languages was considered in Chap-
ter 3. We have seen that every regular language is context-free. Moreover,
there exist languages, for example {anbn : n ≥0}, that are context-free, but
not regular. The following statements are equivalent:
1. The language A is context-free, i.e., there exists a context-free grammar
whose language is A.
2. There exists a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form whose
language is A.
3. There exists a nondeterministic pushdown automaton that accepts A.
This claim was proved by the following conversions:
1. Every context-free grammar can be converted to an equivalent context-
free grammar in Chomsky normal form.
2. Every context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form can be converted
to an equivalent nondeterministic pushdown automaton.
3. Every nondeterministic pushdown automaton can be converted to an
equivalent context-free grammar. (This conversion was not covered in
this book.)
