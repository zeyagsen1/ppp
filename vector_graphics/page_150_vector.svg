Turing Machines and the Church-Turing Thesis
The transition function δ is speciﬁed by the following instructions:
q0a →qa2R
qaa →qaaR
qba →qbaR
q0b →qb2R
qab →qabR
qbb →qbbR
q02 →qaccept
qa2 →q′
a2L
qb2 →q′
b2L
q′
aa →qL2L
q′
ba →qreject
qLa →qLaL
q′
ab →qreject
q′
bb →qL2L
qLb →qLbL
q′
a2 →qaccept
q′
b2 →qaccept
qL2 →q02R
You should go through the computation of this Turing machine for some
sample inputs, for example abba, b, abb and the empty string (which is a
palindrome).
4.2.2
Accepting palindromes using two tapes
We again consider the palindrome problem, but now we use a Turing machine
with two tapes.
Start of the computation: The ﬁrst tape contains the input string w and
the head of the ﬁrst tape is on the leftmost symbol of w. The second tape is
empty and its tape head is at an arbitrary position. The Turing machine is
in the start state q0.
Idea: First, the input string w is copied to the second tape. Then the head
of the ﬁrst tape moves back to the leftmost symbol of w, while the head of
the second tape stays at the rightmost symbol of w. Finally, the actual test
starts: The head of the ﬁrst tape moves to the right and, at the same time,
the head of the second tape moves to the left. While moving, the Turing
machine tests whether the two tape heads read the same symbol in each
step.
The input alphabet is Σ = {a, b} and the tape alphabet is Γ = {a, b, 2}.
The set Q of states consists of the following ﬁve states:
q0 :
start state; copy w to the second tape
q1 :
w has been copied; head of ﬁrst tape moves to the left
q2 :
head of ﬁrst tape moves to the right; head of second tape moves
to the left; until now, all tests were positive
qaccept :
accept state
qreject :
reject state
