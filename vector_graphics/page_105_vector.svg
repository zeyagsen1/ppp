A context-free grammar for the complement of
a nonregular language
Let L be the (nonregular) language L = {0n1n : n ≥0}. We want to prove
that the complement L of L is a context-free language. Hence, we want to
construct a context-free grammar G whose language is equal to L. Observe
that a binary string w is in L if and only if
1. w = 0m1n, for some integers m and n with 0 ≤m < n, or
2. w = 0m1n, for some integers m and n with 0 ≤n < m, or
3. w contains 10 as a substring.
Thus, we can write L as the union of the languages of all strings of type 1.,
type 2., and type 3.
Any string of type 1. is either
• the string 1,
• consists of a string of type 1., followed by one 1, or
• consists of one 0, followed by an arbitrary string of type 1., followed by
one 1.
Thus, using the rules
S1 →1|S11|0S11,
we can derive, from S1, all strings of type 1.
Similarly, using the rules
S2 →0|0S2|0S21,
we can derive, from S2, all strings of type 2.
Any string of type 3.
• consists of an arbitrary binary string, followed by the string 10, followed
by an arbitrary binary string.
Using the rules
X →ϵ|0X|1X,
