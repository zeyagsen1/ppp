Chapter 2.
Finite Automata and Regular Languages
1. Q = {q0} ∪Q1, where q0 is a new state.
2. q0 is the start state of M.
3. F = {q0} ∪F1. (Since ϵ ∈A∗, q0 has to be an accept state.)
4. δ : Q × Σϵ →P(Q) is deﬁned as follows: For any r ∈Q and for any
a ∈Σϵ,
δ(r, a) =


δ1(r, a)
if r ∈Q1 and r ̸∈F1,
δ1(r, a)
if r ∈F1 and a ̸= ϵ,
δ1(r, a) ∪{q1}
if r ∈F1 and a = ϵ,
{q1}
if r = q0 and a = ϵ,
∅
if r = q0 and a ̸= ϵ.
In the ﬁnal theorem of this section, we mention (without proof) two more
closure properties of the regular languages:
Theorem 2.6.4 The set of regular languages is closed under the complement
and intersection operations:
1. If A is a regular language over the alphabet Σ, then the complement
A = {w ∈Σ∗: w ̸∈A}
is also a regular language.
2. If A1 and A2 are regular languages over the same alphabet Σ, then the
intersection
A1 ∩A2 = {w ∈Σ∗: w ∈A1 and w ∈A2}
is also a regular language.
2.7
Regular expressions
In this section, we present regular expressions, which are a means to describe
languages. As we will see, the class of languages that can be described by
regular expressions coincides with the class of regular languages.
