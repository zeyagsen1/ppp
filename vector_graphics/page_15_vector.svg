ϵ, is the string having length zero. For example, if the alphabet Σ is
equal to {0, 1}, then 10, 1000, 0, 101, and ϵ are strings over Σ, having
lengths 2, 4, 1, 3, and 0, respectively.
16. A language is a set of strings.
17. The Boolean values are 1 and 0, that represent true and false, respec-
tively. The basic Boolean operations include
(a) negation (or NOT), represented by ¬,
(b) conjunction (or AND), represented by ∧,
(c) disjunction (or OR), represented by ∨,
(d) exclusive-or (or XOR), represented by ⊕,
(e) equivalence, represented by ↔or ⇔,
(f) implication, represented by →or ⇒.
The following table explains the meanings of these operations.

Proof techniques
In mathematics, a theorem is a statement that is true. A proof is a sequence
of mathematical statements that form an argument to show that a theorem is
true. The statements in the proof of a theorem include axioms (assumptions
about the underlying mathematical structures), hypotheses of the theorem
to be proved, and previously proved theorems. The main question is “How
do we go about proving theorems?” This question is similar to the question
of how to solve a given problem. Of course, the answer is that ﬁnding proofs,
or solving problems, is not easy; otherwise life would be dull! There is no
speciﬁed way of coming up with a proof, but there are some generic strategies
that could be of help. In this section, we review some of these strategies,
that will be suﬃcient for this course. The best way to get a feeling of how
to come up with a proof is by solving a large number of problems. Here are
