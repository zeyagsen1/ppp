3. If u1 ∈Σ, u2 ∈Σ, and u1 ̸= u2, then replace the rule A →u1u2 in the
current set R4 by the three rules A →U1U2, U1 →u1, and U2 →u2,
where U1 and U2 are new variables that are added to the current set
V4.
Observe that in this way, we replace the one-step derivation A ⇒u1u2
by the three-step derivation A ⇒U1U2 ⇒u1U2 ⇒u1u2.
4. If u1 ∈Σ, u2 ∈Σ, and u1 = u2, then replace the rule A →u1u2 = u1u1
in the current set R4 by the two rules A →U1U1 and U1 →u1, where
U1 is a new variable that is added to the current set V4.
Observe that in this way, we replace the one-step derivation A ⇒
u1u2 = u1u1 by the three-step derivation A ⇒U1U1 ⇒u1U1 ⇒u1u1.
Let R5 be the set of rules, and let V5 be the set of variables, after Step 5
has been completed. We deﬁne G5 = (V5, Σ, R5, S5), where S5 = S4. This
grammar has the property that
• the start variable S5 does not occur on the right-hand side of any rule
in R5,
• R5 does not contain any ϵ-rule (it may contain the rule S5 →ϵ),
• R5 does not contain any unit-rule,
• R5 does not contain any rule with more than two symbols on the right-
hand side,
• R5 does not contain any rule of the form A →u1u2, where u1 and u2
are not both variables of V5, and
• L(G5) = L(G4) = L(G3) = L(G2) = L(G1) = L(G).
Since the grammar G5 is in Chomsky normal form, the proof is complete.
