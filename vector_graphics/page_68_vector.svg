M1
Next, we construct an NFA M2 that accepts the language described by
the regular expression b:
M2
b
Next, we apply the construction given in the proof of Theorem 2.6.2 to
M1 and M2. This gives an NFA M3 that accepts the language described by
the regular expression ab:
M3

b
Next, we apply the construction given in the proof of Theorem 2.6.1 to
M3 and M1. This gives an NFA M4 that accepts the language described by
the regular expression ab ∪a:

M4
Finally, we apply the construction given in the proof of Theorem 2.6.3
to M4. This gives an NFA M5 that accepts the language described by the
regular expression (ab ∪a)∗:
