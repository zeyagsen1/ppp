Proof.2
We will sketch the proof for the case when k = 2.
Let M =
(Σ, Γ, Q, δ, q, qaccept, qreject) be a two-tape Turing machine.
Our goal is to
convert M to an equivalent one-tape Turing machine N. That is, N should
have the property that for all strings w ∈Σ∗,
• M accepts w if and only if N accepts w,
• M rejects w if and only if N rejects w,
• M does not terminate on input w if and only if N does not terminate
on input w.
The tape alphabet of the one-tape Turing machine N is
Γ ∪{ ˙x : x ∈Γ} ∪{#}.
In words, we take the tape alphabet Γ of M, and add, for each x ∈Γ, the
symbol ˙x. Moreover, we add a special symbol #.
The Turing machine N will be deﬁned in such a way that any conﬁgura-
tion of the two-tape Turing machine M, for example
. . . 2 1 0 0 1 2 . . .
