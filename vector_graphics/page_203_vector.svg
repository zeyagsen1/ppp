• For any input ⟨P, w⟩, H′ terminates.
• If P terminates on input w, then H′ (when given ⟨P, w⟩as input),
terminates in the accept state.
• If P does not terminate on input w, then H′ (when given ⟨P, w⟩as
input), terminates in the reject state.
Now ﬁnish the proof by arguing that the language HW is undecidable.
5.12 Prove that the language Halt, see Section 5.1.5, is enumerable.
5.13 We deﬁne the following language:
L = {u
:
u = ⟨0, M, w⟩for some ⟨M, w⟩∈ATM,
or u = ⟨1, M, w⟩for some ⟨M, w⟩̸∈ATM } .
Prove that neither L nor its complement L is enumerable.
Hint: There are two ways to solve this exercise. In the ﬁrst solution, (i)
you assume that L is enumerable, and then prove that ATM is decidable, and
(ii) you assume that L is enumerable, and then prove that ATM is decidable.
In the second solution, (i) you assume that L is enumerable, and then prove
that ATM is enumerable, and (ii) you assume that L is enumerable, and then
prove that ATM is enumerable.
