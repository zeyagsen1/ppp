Purpose and motivation
This course is on the Theory of Computation, which tries to answer the
following questions:
• What are the mathematical properties of computer hardware and soft-
ware?
• What is a computation and what is an algorithm? Can we give rigorous
mathematical deﬁnitions of these notions?
• What are the limitations of computers?
Can “everything” be com-
puted? (As we will see, the answer to this question is “no”.)
Purpose of the Theory of Computation: Develop formal math-
ematical models of computation that reﬂect real-world computers.
This ﬁeld of research was started by mathematicians and logicians in the
1930’s, when they were trying to understand the meaning of a “computation”.
A central question asked was whether all mathematical problems can be
solved in a systematic way. The research that started in those days led to
computers as we know them today.
Nowadays, the Theory of Computation can be divided into the follow-
ing three areas: Complexity Theory, Computability Theory, and Automata
Theory.
