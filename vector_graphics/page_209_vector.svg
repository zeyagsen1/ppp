We claim that 2Color ∈P. In order to show this, we have to construct an
algorithm that decides in polynomial time, whether or not any given graph
is 2-colorable.
Let G be an arbitrary graph with vertex set V = {1, 2, . . . , m}. The edge
set of G is given by an adjacency matrix. This matrix, which we denote by
E, is a two-dimensional array with m rows and m columns. For all i and j
with 1 ≤i ≤m and 1 ≤j ≤m, we have
E(i, j) =
 1
if (i, j) is an edge of G,
0
otherwise.
The length of the input G, i.e., the number of bits needed to specify G, is
equal to m2 =: n. We will present an algorithm that decides, in O(n) time,
whether or not the graph G is 2-colorable.
The algorithm uses the colors red and blue. It gives the ﬁrst vertex the
color red. Then, the algorithm considers all vertices that are connected by
an edge to the ﬁrst vertex, and colors them blue. Now the algorithm is done
with the ﬁrst vertex; it marks this ﬁrst vertex.
Next, the algorithm chooses a vertex i that already has a color, but that
has not been marked. Then it considers all vertices j that are connected by
an edge to i. If j has the same color as i, then the input graph G is not
2-colorable. Otherwise, if vertex j does not have a color yet, the algorithm
gives j the color that is diﬀerent from i’s color. After having done this for
all neighbors j of i, the algorithm is done with vertex i, so it marks i.
It may happen that there is no vertex i that already has a color but that
has not been marked. (In other words, each vertex i that is not marked does
not have a color yet.) In this case, the algorithm chooses an arbitrary vertex
i having this property, and colors it red. (This vertex i is the ﬁrst vertex in
its connected component that gets a color.)
This procedure is repeated until all vertices of G have been marked.
We now give a formal description of this algorithm. Vertex i has been
marked, if
1. i has a color,
2. all vertices that are connected by an edge to i have a color, and
3. the algorithm has veriﬁed that each vertex that is connected by an edge
to i has a color diﬀerent from i’s color.
