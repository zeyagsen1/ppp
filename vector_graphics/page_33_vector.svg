Let us denote this ﬁnite automaton by M. The language of M, denoted
by L(M), is the set of all binary strings that are accepted by M. As we have
seen before, we have
L(M) = {w : w contains at least one 1 and ends with an even number of 0s}.
We now give a formal deﬁnition of the language of a ﬁnite automaton:
Deﬁnition 2.2.2 Let M = (Q, Σ, δ, q, F) be a ﬁnite automaton and let w =
w1w2 . . . wn be a string over Σ. Deﬁne the sequence r0, r1, . . . , rn of states, in
the following way:
• r0 = q,
• ri+1 = δ(ri, wi+1), for i = 0, 1, . . . , n −1.
1. If rn ∈F, then we say that M accepts w.
2. If rn ̸∈F, then we say that M rejects w.
In this deﬁnition, w may be the empty string, which we denote by ϵ, and
whose length is zero; thus in the deﬁnition above, n = 0. In this case, the
sequence r0, r1, . . . , rn of states has length one; it consists of just the state
r0 = q. The empty string is accepted by M if and only if the start state q
belongs to F.
Deﬁnition 2.2.3 Let M = (Q, Σ, δ, q, F) be a ﬁnite automaton. The lan-
guage L(M) accepted by M is deﬁned to be the set of all strings that are
accepted by M:
L(M) = {w : w is a string over Σ and M accepts w }.
Deﬁnition 2.2.4 A language A is called regular, if there exists a ﬁnite au-
tomaton M such that A = L(M).
