Preface
This is a free textbook for an undergraduate course on the Theory of Com-
putation, which we have been teaching at Carleton University since 2002.
Until the 2011/2012 academic year, this course was oﬀered as a second-year
course (COMP 2805) and was compulsory for all Computer Science students.
Starting with the 2012/2013 academic year, the course has been downgraded
to a third-year optional course (COMP 3803).
We have been developing this book since we started teaching this course.
Currently, we cover most of the material from Chapters 2–5 during a 12-week
term with three hours of classes per week.
The material from Chapter 6, on Complexity Theory, is taught in the
third-year course COMP 3804 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms). In the
early years of COMP 2805, we gave a two-lecture overview of Complexity
Theory at the end of the term. Even though this overview has disappeared
from the course, we decided to keep Chapter 6. This chapter has not been
revised/modiﬁed for a long time.
The course as we teach it today has been inﬂuenced by the following two
textbooks:
• Introduction to the Theory of Computation (second edition), by Michael
Sipser, Thomson Course Technnology, Boston, 2006.
• Einf¨uhrung in die Theoretische Informatik, by Klaus Wagner, Springer-
Verlag, Berlin, 1994.
Besides reading this text, we recommend that you also take a look at
these excellent textbooks, as well as one or more of the following ones:
• Elements of the Theory of Computation (second edition), by Harry
Lewis and Christos Papadimitriou, Prentice-Hall, 1998.
