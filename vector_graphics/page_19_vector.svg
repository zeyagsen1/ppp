Proofs by contradiction
This is how a proof by contradiction looks like:
Theorem 1.3.7 Statement S is true.
Proof. Assume that statement S is false. Then, derive a contradiction (such
as 1 + 1 = 3).
In other words, show that the statement “¬S ⇒false” is true. This is
suﬃcient, because the contrapositive of the statement “¬S ⇒false” is the
statement “true ⇒S”. The latter logical formula is equivalent to S, and
that is what we wanted to show.
Below, we give two examples of proofs by contradiction.
Theorem 1.3.8 Let n be a positive integer. If n2 is even, then n is even.
Proof. We will prove the theorem by contradiction. So we assume that n2
is even, but n is odd. Since n is odd, we know from Theorem 1.3.1 that n2
is odd. This is a contradiction, because we assumed that n2 is even.
Theorem 1.3.9
√
2 is irrational, i.e.,
√
2 cannot be written as a fraction of
two integers m and n.
Proof. We will prove the theorem by contradiction. So we assume that
√
2
is rational. Then
√
2 can be written as a fraction of two integers,
√
2 = m/n,
where m ≥1 and n ≥1. We may assume that m and n do not share any
common factors, i.e., the greatest common divisor of m and n is equal to
one; if this is not the case, then we can get rid of the common factors. By
squaring
√
2 = m/n, we get 2n2 = m2. This implies that m2 is even. Then,
by Theorem 1.3.8, m is even, which means that we can write m as m = 2k,
for some positive integer k. It follows that 2n2 = m2 = 4k2, which implies
that n2 = 2k2. Hence, n2 is even. Again by Theorem 1.3.8, it follows that n
is even.
We have shown that m and n are both even. But we know that m and
n are not both even. Hence, we have a contradiction. Our assumption that
√
2 is rational is wrong. Thus, we can conclude that
√
2 is irrational.
There is a nice discussion of this proof in the book My Brain is Open:
