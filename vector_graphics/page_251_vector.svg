Chapter 7.
Summary
243
The following properties hold:
1. Every context-free language is in P. (We did not prove this).
2. Every language in P is also in NP.
3. It is not known if there exist languages that are in NP, but not in P.
4. Every language in NP is decidable.
We have introduced reductions to deﬁne the notion of a language B to be
“at least as hard” as a language A. A language B is called NP-complete, if
1. B belongs to the class NP, and
2. B is at least as hard as every language in the class NP.
We have seen that NP-complete exist.
The ﬁgure below summarizes the relationships among the various classes
of languages.
