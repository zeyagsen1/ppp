We map this domino game D to a Boolean formula ϕ, such that (6.10)
holds. The formula ϕ will have variables
xijℓ, 1 ≤i ≤t, 1 ≤j ≤t, 1 ≤ℓ≤k.
These variables can be interpretated as follows:
xijℓ= 1 ⇐⇒there is a tile of type Tℓat position (i, j) of the frame.
We deﬁne:
• For all i and j with 1 ≤i ≤t and 1 ≤j ≤t:
C1
ij := xij1 ∨xij2 ∨. . . ∨xijk.
This formula expresses the condition that there is at least one tile at
position (i, j).
• For all i, j, ℓand ℓ′ with 1 ≤i ≤t, 1 ≤j ≤t, and 1 ≤ℓ< ℓ′ ≤k:
C2
ijℓℓ′ := ¬xijℓ∨¬xijℓ′.
This formula expresses the condition that there is at most one tile at
position (i, j).
• For all i, j, ℓand ℓ′ with 1 ≤i ≤t, 1 ≤j < t, 1 ≤ℓ≤k and 1 ≤ℓ′ ≤k,
such that i < t and the right symbol on a tile of type Tℓis not equal
to the left symbol on a tile of type Tℓ′:
C3
ijℓℓ′ := ¬xijℓ∨¬xi,j+1,ℓ′.
This formula expresses the condition that neighboring tiles in the same
row “ﬁt” together. There are symmetric formulas for neighboring tiles
in the same column.
• For all j and ℓwith 1 ≤j ≤t and 1 ≤ℓ≤k, such that the top symbol
on a tile of type Tℓis not equal to the symbol at position j of the upper
boundary of the frame:
C4
jℓ:= ¬x1jℓ.
This formula expresses the condition that tiles that touch the upper
boundary of the frame “ﬁt” there. There are symmetric formulas for
the lower, left, and right boundaries of the frame.
