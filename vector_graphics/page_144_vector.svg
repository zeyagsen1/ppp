Context-Free Languages
• {an b a2n b a3n : n ≥0}.
• {anbnanbn : n ≥0}.
• {ambnck : m ≥0, n ≥0, k = max(m, n)}.
• {w#x : w is a substring of x, and w, x ∈{a, b}∗}.
For example, the string aba#abbababbb is in the language, whereas the
string aba#baabbaabb is not in the language. The alphabet is {a, b, #}.
•
{ w ∈{a, b, c}∗
:
w contains more b’s than a’s and
w contains more c’s than a’s }.
• {1n : n is a prime number}.
• {(abn)n : n ≥0}. (The parentheses are not part of the alphabet; thus,
the alphabet is {a, b, }.)
3.11 Let L be a language consisting of ﬁnitely many strings. Show that L
is regular and, therefore, context-free. Let k be the maximum length of any
string in L.
• Prove that every context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form that
generates L has more than log k variables. (The logarithm is in base
2.)
• Prove that there is a context-free grammar that generates L and that
has only one variable.
3.12 Let L be a context-free language. Prove that there exists an integer
p ≥1, such that the following is true: For every string s in L with |s| ≥p,
there exists a string s′ in L such that |s| < |s′| ≤|s| + p.
