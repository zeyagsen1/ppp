The formula ϕ is the conjunction of all these formulas C1
ij, C2
ijℓℓ′, C3
ijℓℓ′, and
C4
jℓ. The complete formula ϕ consists of
O(t2k + t2k2 + t2k2 + tk) = O(t2k2)
terms, i.e., its length is polynomial in the length of the domino game. This
implies that ϕ can be constructed in polynomial time. Hence, the function
f that maps the domino game D to the Boolean formula ϕ, is in the class
FP. It is not diﬃcult to see that (6.10) holds for this function f. Therefore,
we have proved the following result.
Theorem 6.5.13 The language SAT is NP-complete.
In Section 6.5.1, we have deﬁned the language 3SAT.
Theorem 6.5.14 The language 3SAT is NP-complete.
Proof. It is clear that 3SAT ∈NP. If we can show that
SAT ≤P 3SAT,
then the claim follows from Theorem 6.5.11. Let
ϕ = C1 ∧C2 ∧. . . ∧Ck
be an input for SAT, in the variables x1, x2, . . . , xm. We map ϕ, in polynomial
time, to an input ϕ′ for 3SAT, such that
ϕ is satisﬁable ⇐⇒ϕ′ is satisﬁable.
