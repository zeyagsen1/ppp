3. Prove that the language BP is NP-complete. Again, you may use the
fact that the language SP is NP-complete.
6.6 Prove that 3Color ≤P 3SAT.
Hint: For each vertex i, and for each of the three colors k, introduce a
Boolean variable xik.
6.7 The (0, 1)-integer programming language IP is deﬁned as follows:
IP := {⟨A, c⟩:
A is an integer m × n matrix for some m, n ∈N,
c is an integer vector of length m, and
∃x ∈{0, 1}n such that Ax ≤c (componentwise) }.
Prove that the language IP is NP-complete. You may use the fact that
the language SOS is NP-complete.
6.8 Let ϕ be a Boolean formula in the variables x1, x2, . . . , xm.
We say that ϕ is in disjunctive normal form (DNF) if it is of the form
ϕ = C1 ∨C2 ∨. . . ∨Ck,
(6.12)
where each Ci, 1 ≤i ≤k, is of the following form:
Ci = ℓi
1 ∧ℓi
2 ∧. . . ∧ℓi
ki.
Each ℓi
j is a literal, which is either a variable or the negation of a variable.
We say that ϕ is in conjunctive normal form (CNF) if it is of the form
ϕ = C1 ∧C2 ∧. . . ∧Ck,
(6.13)
where each Ci, 1 ≤i ≤k, is of the following form:
Ci = ℓi
1 ∨ℓi
2 ∨. . . ∨ℓi
ki.
Again, each ℓi
j is a literal.
We deﬁne the following two languages:
DNFSAT := {⟨ϕ⟩: ϕ is in DNF-form and is satisﬁable},
and
CNFSAT := {⟨ϕ⟩: ϕ is in CNF-form and is satisﬁable}.
