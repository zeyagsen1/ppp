Chapter 7.
Summary
241
Nondeterministic pushdown automata are more powerful than determin-
istic pushdown automata: There exists a nondeterministic pushdown au-
tomaton that accepts the language
{vbw : v ∈{a, b}∗, w ∈{a, b}∗, |v| = |w|},
but there is no deterministic pushdown automaton that accepts this language.
(We did not prove this in this book.)
We have seen that the class of context-free languages is closed under
the union, concatenation, and star operations: If A and B are context-free
languages, then
1. A ∪B is context-free,
2. AB is context-free, and
3. A∗is context-free.
However,
1. the intersection of two context-free languages is not necessarily context-
free, and
2. the complement of a context-free language is not necessarily context-
free.
Finally, the pumping lemma for context-free languages gives a property
that every context-free language possesses. We have used this to prove that
languages such as {anbncn : n ≥0} are not context-free.
The Church-Turing Thesis:
In Chapter 4, we considered “reasonable”
computational devices that model real computers. Examples of such devices
are Turing machines (with one or more tapes) and Java programs. It turns
out that all known “reasonable” devices are equivalent, i.e., can be converted
to each other. This led to the Church-Turing Thesis:
• Every computational process that is intuitively considered to be an
algorithm can be converted to a Turing machine.
