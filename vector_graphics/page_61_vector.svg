Regular expressions
53
Before formally deﬁning the notion of a regular expression, we give some
examples. Consider the expression
(0 ∪1)01∗.
The language described by this expression is the set of all binary strings
1. that start with either 0 or 1 (this is indicated by (0 ∪1)),
2. for which the second symbol is 0 (this is indicated by 0), and
3. that end with zero or more 1s (this is indicated by 1∗).
That is, the language described by this expression is
{00, 001, 0011, 00111, . . . , 10, 101, 1011, 10111, . . .}.
Here are some more examples (in all cases, the alphabet is {0, 1}):
• The language {w : w contains exactly two 0s} is described by the ex-
pression
1∗01∗01∗.
• The language {w : w contains at least two 0s} is described by the ex-
pression
(0 ∪1)∗0(0 ∪1)∗0(0 ∪1)∗.
• The language {w : 1011 is a substring of w} is described by the ex-
pression
(0 ∪1)∗1011(0 ∪1)∗.
• The language {w : the length of w is even} is described by the expres-
sion
((0 ∪1)(0 ∪1))∗.
• The language {w : the length of w is odd} is described by the expres-
sion
(0 ∪1) ((0 ∪1)(0 ∪1))∗.
• The language {1011, 0} is described by the expression
1011 ∪0.
