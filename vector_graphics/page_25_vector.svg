Let us ﬁrst assume that G′ is connected. Then the graph G is connected
as well, because there is at least one edge in G between v and some vertex
of G′.
If G′ is not connected, then G′ must be connected. Since we are in Case 3,
we know that the degree of v in G is in the set {1, 2, . . . , n −1}. It follows
that the degree of v in the graph G is in this set as well. Hence, there is at
least one edge in G between v and some vertex in G′. This implies that G is
connected.
The previous theorem can be rephrased as follows:
Theorem 1.3.16 Let n ≥2 and consider the complete graph Kn on n ver-
tices. Color each edge of this graph as either red or blue. Let R be the graph
consisting of all the red edges, and let B be the graph consisting of all the
blue edges. Then R is connected or B is connected.
A graph is said to be planar, if it can be drawn (a better term is “embed-
ded”) in the plane in such a way that no two edges intersect, except possibly
at their endpoints.
An embedding of a planar graph consists of vertices,
edges, and faces. In the example below, there are 11 vertices, 18 edges, and
9 faces (including the unbounded face).
The following theorem is known as Euler’s theorem for planar graphs.
Apparently, this theorem was discovered by Euler around 1750. Legendre
gave the ﬁrst proof in 1794, see
