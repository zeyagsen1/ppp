Finite Automata and Regular Languages
How do we deﬁne the start state q′ of the DFA M? Before the NFA N
reads its ﬁrst “real” symbol of Σ, it makes zero or more ϵ-transitions. In
other words, at the moment when N reads the ﬁrst symbol of Σ, it can be
in any state of Cϵ(q). Therefore, we deﬁne q′ to be
q′ = Cϵ(q) = Cϵ({q}).
How do we deﬁne the transition function δ′ of the DFA M? Assume that
M is in state R, and reads the symbol a. At this moment, the NFA N would
have been in any state r of R. By reading the symbol a, N can switch to
any state in δ(r, a), and then make zero or more ϵ-transitions. Hence, the
NFA can switch to any state in the set Cϵ(δ(r, a)). Based on this, we deﬁne
δ′(R, a) to be
δ′(R, a) =
[
r∈R
Cϵ(δ(r, a)).
To summarize, the NFA N = (Q, Σ, δ, q, F) is converted to the DFA
M = (Q′, Σ, δ′, q′, F ′), where
• Q′ = P(Q),
• q′ = Cϵ({q}),
• F ′ = {R ∈Q′ : R ∩F ̸= ∅},
• δ′ : Q′ × Σ →Q′ is deﬁned as follows: For each R ∈Q′ and for each
a ∈Σ,
δ′(R, a) =
[
r∈R
Cϵ(δ(r, a)).
The results proved until now can be summarized in the following theorem.
Theorem 2.5.2 Let A be a language. Then A is regular if and only if there
exists a nondeterministic ﬁnite automaton that accepts A.

An example
Consider the NFA N = (Q, Σ, δ, q, F), where Q = {1, 2, 3}, Σ = {a, b}, q = 1,
F = {2}, and δ is given by the following table:
