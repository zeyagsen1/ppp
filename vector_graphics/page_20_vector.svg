The pigeon hole principle
This is a simple principle with surprising consequences.
Pigeon Hole Principle: If n + 1 or more objects are placed into n
boxes, then there is at least one box containing two or more objects.
In other words, if A and B are two sets such that |A| > |B|, then
there is no one-to-one function from A to B.
Theorem 1.3.10 Let n be a positive integer. Every sequence of n2 + 1 dis-
tinct real numbers contains a subsequence of length n + 1 that is either in-
creasing or decreasing.
Proof. For example consider the sequence (20, 10, 9, 7, 11, 2, 21, 1, 20, 31) of
10 = 32 + 1 numbers. This sequence contains an increasing subsequence of
length 4 = 3 + 1, namely (10, 11, 21, 31).
The proof of this theorem is by contradiction, and uses the pigeon hole
principle.
Let (a1, a2, . . . , an2+1) be an arbitrary sequence of n2 + 1 distinct real
numbers. For each i with 1 ≤i ≤n2 + 1, let inci denote the length of
the longest increasing subsequence that starts at ai, and let deci denote the
length of the longest decreasing subsequence that starts at ai.
Using this notation, the claim in the theorem can be formulated as follows:
There is an index i such that inci ≥n + 1 or deci ≥n + 1.
We will prove the claim by contradiction. So we assume that inci ≤n
and deci ≤n for all i with 1 ≤i ≤n2 + 1.
Consider the set
B = {(b, c) : 1 ≤b ≤n, 1 ≤c ≤n},
and think of the elements of B as being boxes. For each i with 1 ≤i ≤n2+1,
the pair (inci, deci) is an element of B. So we have n2+1 elements (inci, deci),
which are placed in the n2 boxes of B. By the pigeon hole principle, there
must be a box that contains two (or more) elements. In other words, there
exist two integers i and j such that i < j and
(inci, deci) = (incj, decj).
Recall that the elements in the sequence are distinct. Hence, ai ̸= aj. We
consider two cases.
