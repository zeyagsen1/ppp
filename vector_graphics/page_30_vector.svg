• The machine is in state q3, if it has collected exactly 15 cents.
• The machine is in state q4, if it has collected exactly 20 cents.
• The machine is in state q5, if it has collected 25 cents or more.
Initially (when a car arrives at the toll gate), the machine is in state q0.
Assume, for example, that the driver presents the sequence (10,5,5,10) of
coins.
• After receiving the ﬁrst 10 cents coin, the machine switches from state
q0 to state q2.
• After receiving the ﬁrst 5 cents coin, the machine switches from state
q2 to state q3.
• After receiving the second 5 cents coin, the machine switches from state
q3 to state q4.
• After receiving the second 10 cents coin, the machine switches from
state q4 to state q5. At this moment, the gate opens. (Remember that
no change is given.)
The ﬁgure below represents the behavior of the machine for all possible
sequences of coins. State q5 is represented by two circles, because it is a
special state: As soon as the machine reaches this state, the gate opens.

Observe that the machine (or computer) only has to remember which
state it is in at any given time. Thus, it needs only a very small amount
of memory: It has to be able to distinguish between any one of six possible
cases and, therefore, it only needs a memory of ⌈log 6⌉= 3 bits.
