Chapter 1.
Introduction
We have to prove that the theorem is true for n + 1, i.e., we have to prove
that
1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + (n + 1) = (n + 1)(n + 2)

Here is the proof:
1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + (n + 1)

1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + n

+ (n + 1)
=
(n + 1)(n + 2)

By the way, here is an alternative proof of the theorem above: Let S =
1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + n. Then,

Since there are n terms on the right-hand side, we have 2S = n(n + 1). This
implies that S = n(n + 1)/2.
Theorem 1.3.12 For every positive integer n, a −b is a factor of an −bn.
Proof. A direct proof can be given by providing a factorization of an −bn:
an −bn = (a −b)(an−1 + an−2b + an−3b2 + . . . + abn−2 + bn−1).
We now prove the theorem by induction. For the basis, let n = 1. The claim
in the theorem is “a −b is a factor of a −b”, which is obviously true.
Let n ≥1 and assume that a −b is a factor of an −bn. We have to prove
that a −b is a factor of an+1 −bn+1. We have
an+1 −bn+1 = an+1 −anb + anb −bn+1 = an(a −b) + (an −bn)b.
The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is divisible by a −b. By the induction
hypothesis, the second term on the right-hand side is divisible by a −b as
well. Therefore, the entire right-hand side is divisible by a −b. Since the
right-hand side is equal to an+1 −bn+1, it follows that a −b is a factor of
an+1 −bn+1.
We now give an alternative proof of Theorem 1.3.3:
