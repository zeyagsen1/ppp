First assume that ai < aj. Then the length of the longest increasing
subsequence starting at ai must be at least 1+incj, because we can append ai
to the longest increasing subsequence starting at aj. Therefore, inci ̸= incj,
which is a contradiction.
The second case is when ai > aj. Then the length of the longest decreasing
subsequence starting at ai must be at least 1+decj, because we can append ai
to the longest decreasing subsequence starting at aj. Therefore, deci ̸= decj,
which is again a contradiction.

Proofs by induction
This is a very powerful and important technique for proving theorems.
For each positive integer n, let P(n) be a mathematical statement that
depends on n. Assume we wish to prove that P(n) is true for all positive
integers n. A proof by induction of such a statement is carried out as follows:
Basis: Prove that P(1) is true.
Induction step: Prove that for all n ≥1, the following holds: If P(n) is
true, then P(n + 1) is also true.
In the induction step, we choose an arbitrary integer n ≥1 and assume
that P(n) is true; this is called the induction hypothesis. Then we prove that
P(n + 1) is also true.
Theorem 1.3.11 For all positive integers n, we have
1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + n = n(n + 1)

.
Proof. We start with the basis of the induction. If n = 1, then the left-hand
side is equal to 1, and so is the right-hand side. So the theorem is true for
n = 1.
For the induction step, let n ≥1 and assume that the theorem is true for
n, i.e., assume that
1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + n = n(n + 1)
