Consider the string uv2xy2z. Since |vy| ≥1, this string consists of p
many as, p many bs, but more than p2 many cs. Therefore, this string is not
contained in A. But, by the pumping lemma, it is contained in A.
Case 2: The substring v does not contain any c and the substring y does
not contain any c.
Consider again the string uv2xy2z. This string consists of p2 many cs.
Since |vy| ≥1, in this string,
• the number of as is at least p + 1 and the number of bs is at least p, or
• the number of as is at least p and the number of bs is at least p + 1.
Therefore, the number of as multiplied by the number of bs is at least p(p+1),
which is larger than p2. Therefore, uv2xy2z is not contained in A. But, by
the pumping lemma, this string is contained in A.
Case 3: The substring v contains at least one b and the substring y contains
at least one c.
Since |vxy| ≤p, the substring vy does not contain any a. Thus, we can
write vy = bjck, where j ≥1 and k ≥1. Consider the string uxz. We can
write this string as uxz = apbp−jcp2−k. Since, by the pumping lemma, this
string is contained in A, we have p(p−j) = p2−k, which implies that jp = k.
Thus,
|vxy| ≥|vy| = j + k = j + jp ≥1 + p.
But, by the pumping lemma, we have |vxy| ≤p.
Observe that, since |vxy| ≤p, the above three cases cover all possibilities
for the locations of v and y in the string s. In each of the three cases, we
have obtained a contradiction. Therefore, the language A is not context-free.
