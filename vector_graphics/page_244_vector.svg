6.1 Prove that the function F : N →N, deﬁned by F(x) := 2x, is not in FP.
6.2 Prove Theorem 6.5.3.
6.3 Prove that the language Clique is in the class NP.
6.4 Prove that the language 3SAT is in the class NP.
6.5 We deﬁne the following languages:
• Sum of subset:
SOS := {⟨a1, a2, . . . , am, b⟩: ∃I ⊆{1, 2, . . . , m},
X
i∈I
ai = b}.
• Set partition:
SP := {⟨a1, a2, . . . , am⟩: ∃I ⊆{1, 2, . . . , m},
X
i∈I
ai =
X
i̸∈I
ai}.
• Bin packing: BP is the set of all strings ⟨s1, s2, . . . , sm, B⟩for which
1. 0 < si < 1, for all i,
2. B ∈N,
3. the numbers s1, s2, . . . , sm ﬁt into B bins, where each bin has size
one, i.e., there exists a partition of {1, 2, . . . , m} into subsets Ik,
1 ≤k ≤B, such that P
i∈Ik si ≤1 for all k, 1 ≤k ≤B.
For example, ⟨1/6, 1/2, 1/5, 1/9, 3/5, 1/5, 1/2, 11/18, 3⟩∈BP, because
the eight fractions ﬁt into three bins:
1/6 + 1/9 + 11/18 ≤1, 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, and 1/5 + 3/5 + 1/5 = 1.
1. Prove that SOS ≤P SP.
2. Prove that the language SOS is NP-complete. You may use the fact
that the language SP is NP-complete.
