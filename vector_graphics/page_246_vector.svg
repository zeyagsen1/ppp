1. Prove that the language DNFSAT is in P.
2. What is wrong with the following argument: Since we can rewrite
any Boolean formula in DNF-form, we have CNFSAT ≤P DNFSAT.
Hence, since CNFSAT is NP-complete and since DNFSAT ∈P, we
have P = NP.
3. Prove directly that for every language A in P, A ≤P CNFSAT. “Di-
rectly” means that you should not use the fact that CNFSAT is NP-
complete.
6.9 1 Prove that the polynomial upper bound on the length of the string y
in the deﬁnition of NP is necessary, in the sense that if it is left out, then
any enumerable language would satisfy the condition.
More precisely, we say that the language A belongs to the class E, if there
exists a language B ∈P, such that for every string w,
w ∈A ⇐⇒∃y : ⟨w, y⟩∈B.
Prove that E is equal to the class of all enumerable languages.
1Thanks to Antoine Vigneron for poining out an error in a previous version of this
exercise.
