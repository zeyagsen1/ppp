Turing Machines and the Church-Turing Thesis
Thus, the contents of the two tapes of M are encoded on the single tape of
N. The dotted symbols are used to indicate the positions of the two tape
heads of M, whereas the three occurrences of the special symbol # are used
to mark the boundaries of the strings on the two tapes of M.
The Turing machine N simulates one computation step of M, in the
following way:
• Throughout the simulation of this step, N “remembers” the current
state of M.
• At the start of the simulation, the tape head of N is on the leftmost
symbol #.
• N walks along the string to the right until it ﬁnds the ﬁrst dotted
symbol. (This symbol indicates the location of the head on the ﬁrst tape
of M.) N remembers this ﬁrst dotted symbol and continues walking
to the right until it ﬁnds the second dotted symbol.
(This symbol
indicates the location of the head on the second tape of M.) Again, N
remembers this second dotted symbol.
• At this moment, N is still at the second dotted symbol. N updates
this part of the tape, by making the change that M would make on its
second tape. (This change is given by the transition function of M; it
depends on the current state of M and the two symbols that M reads
on its two tapes.)
• N walks to the left until it ﬁnds the ﬁrst dotted symbol.
Then, it
updates this part of the tape, by making the change that M would
make on its ﬁrst tape.
• In the previous two steps, in which the tape is updated, it may be
necessary to shift a part of the tape.
• Finally, N remembers the new state of M and walks back to the left-
most symbol #.
It should be clear that the Turing machine N can be constructed by
introducing appropriate states.
