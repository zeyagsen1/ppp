Theorem 6.5.5 SOS ≤P KS.
Proof. Let us ﬁrst see what we have to show. According to Deﬁnition 6.5.1,
we need a function f ∈FP, that maps input strings for SOS to input strings
for KS, in such a way that
⟨a1, . . . , am, b⟩∈SOS ⇐⇒f(⟨a1, . . . , am, b⟩) ∈KS.
In order for f(⟨a1, . . . , am, b⟩) to be an input string for KS, this function
value has to be of the form
f(⟨a1, . . . , am, b⟩) = ⟨w1, . . . , wm, k1, . . . , km, W, K⟩.
We deﬁne
f(⟨a1, . . . , am, b⟩) := ⟨a1, . . . , am, a1, . . . , am, b, b⟩.
It is clear that f ∈FP. We have
⟨a1, . . . , am, b⟩∈SOS
⇐⇒
there exist c1, . . . , cm ∈{0, 1} such that Pm
i=1 ciai = b
⇐⇒
there exist c1, . . . , cm ∈{0, 1} such that Pm
i=1 ciai ≤b and Pm
i=1 ciai ≥b
⇐⇒
⟨a1, . . . , am, a1, . . . , am, b, b⟩∈KS
⇐⇒
f(⟨a1, . . . , am, b⟩) ∈KS.
Cliques and Boolean formulas
We will deﬁne two languages A = 3SAT and B = Clique that have, at
ﬁrst sight, nothing to do with each other. Then we show that, nevertheless,
A ≤P B.
Let G be a graph with vertex set V and edge set E. A subset V ′ of V is
called a clique, if each pair of distinct vertices in V ′ is connected by an edge
in E. We deﬁne the following language:
Clique := {⟨G, k⟩: k ∈N and G has a clique with k vertices}.
We encourage you to prove the following claim:
