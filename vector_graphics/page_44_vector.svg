Finite Automata and Regular Languages
– If the automaton stays in state q1, then it is still in this state after
having read the third symbol.
– If the automaton switches to state q2, then it again has two op-
tions:
∗Either read the third symbol in the input string, which is 0,
and switch to state q3,
∗or switch to state q3, without reading the third symbol.
If we continue in this way, then we see that, for the input string 010110,
there are seven possible computations. All these computations are given in
the ﬁgure below.

Consider the lowest path in the ﬁgure above:
• When reading the ﬁrst symbol, the automaton stays in state q1.
• When reading the second symbol, the automaton switches to state q2.
• The automaton does not read the third symbol (equivalently, it “reads”
the empty string ϵ), and switches to state q3. At this moment, the
