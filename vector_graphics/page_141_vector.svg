• {w : w is a palindrome}.
A palindrome is a string w having the property that w = wR, i.e.,
reading w from left to right gives the same result as reading w from
right to left.
• {w : w starts and ends with the same symbol}
• {w : w starts and ends with diﬀerent symbols}
3.2 Let G = (V, Σ, R, S) be the context-free grammar, where V = {A, B, S},
Σ = {0, 1}, S is the start variable, and R consists of the rules
S
→
0S|1A|ϵ
A
→
0B|1S
B
→
0A|1B
Deﬁne the following language L:
L = {w ∈{0, 1}∗:
w is the binary representation of a non-negative
integer that is divisible by three } ∪{ϵ}.
Prove that L = L(G). (Hint: The variables S, A, and B are used to
remember the remainder after division by three.)
3.3 Let G = (V, Σ, R, S) be the context-free grammar, where V = {A, B, S},
Σ = {a, b}, S is the start variable, and R consists of the rules
S
→
aB|bA
A
→
a|aS|BAA
B

b|bS|ABB
• Prove that ababba ∈L(G).
• Prove that L(G) is the set of all non-empty strings w over the alphabet
{a, b} such that the number of as in w is equal to the number of bs in
w.
3.4 Let A and B be context-free languages over the same alphabet Σ.
• Prove that the union A ∪B of A and B is also context-free.
• Prove that the concatenation AB of A and B is also context-free.
