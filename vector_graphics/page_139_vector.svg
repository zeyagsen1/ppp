The pumping lemma for context-free languages
131
In both cases, we conclude that the string uxz is not an element of the
language B. But, by the pumping lemma, this string is contained in B.
Case 2: The substring vxy is in the leftmost half of s.
In this case, none of the strings uxz, uv2xy2z, uv3xy3z, uv4xy4z, etc.,
is contained in B.
But, by the pumping lemma, each of these strings is
contained in B.
Case 3: The substring vxy is in the rightmost half of s.
This case is symmetric to Case 2: None of the strings uxz, uv2xy2z,
uv3xy3z, uv4xy4z, etc., is contained in B. But, by the pumping lemma, each
of these strings is contained in B.
To summarize, in each of the three cases, we have obtained a contradic-
tion. Therefore, the language B is not context-free.
Third example
We have seen in Section 3.2.4 that the language
{ambncm+n : m ≥0, n ≥0}
is context-free. Using the pumping lemma for regular languages, it is easy to
prove that this language is not regular. In other words, context-free gram-
mars can verify addition, whereas ﬁnite automata are not powerful enough
for this. We now consider the problem of verifying multiplication: Let A be
the language deﬁned as
A = {ambncmn : m ≥0, n ≥0}.
We will prove by contradiction that A is not a context-free language.
Assume that A is context-free. Let p ≥1 be the pumping length, as
given by the pumping lemma. Consider the string s = apbpcp2. Then, s ∈A
and |s| = 2p + p2 ≥p. Hence, by the pumping lemma, s can be written as
s = uvxyz, where |vy| ≥1, |vxy| ≤p, and uvixyiz ∈A for all i ≥0.
There are three possible cases, depending on the locations of v and y in
the string s.
Case 1: The substring v does not contain any a and does not contain any
b, and the substring y does not contain any a and does not contain any b.
