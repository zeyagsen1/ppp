2. {w : 110 is not a substring of w}
3. {w : w contains at least ﬁve 1s}
4. {w : w contains the substring 1011}
5. {w : w contains at least two 1s and at most two 0s}
6. {w : w contains an odd number of 1s or exactly two 0s}
7. {w : w begins with 1 and ends with 0}
8. {w : every odd position in w is 1}
9. {w : w has length at least 3 and its third symbol is 0}
10. {ϵ, 0}
2.2 For each of the following languages, construct an NFA, with the speciﬁed
number of states, that accepts the language. In all cases, the alphabet is
{0, 1}.
1. The language {w : w ends with 10} with three states.
2. The language {w : w contains the substring 1011} with ﬁve states.
3. The language {w : w contains an odd number of 1s or exactly two 0s}
with six states.
2.3 For each of the following languages, construct an NFA that accepts the
language. In all cases, the alphabet is {0, 1}.
1. {w : w contains the substring 11001}
2. {w : w has length at least 2 and does not end with 10}
3. {w : w begins with 1 or ends with 0}
2.4 Convert the following NFA to an equivalent DFA.
