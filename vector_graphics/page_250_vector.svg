Summary
Decidable and enumerable languages:
These classes of languages were
considered in Chapter 5. They are deﬁned based on “reasonable” computa-
tional devices, such as Turing machines and Java programs. We have seen
that
1. every context-free language is decidable, and
2. every decidable language is enumerable.
Moreover,
1. there exist languages, for example {anbncn : n ≥0}, that are decidable,
but not context-free,
2. there exist languages, for example the Halting Problem, that are enu-
merable, but not decidable,
3. there exist languages, for example the complement of the Halting Prob-
lem, that are not enumerable.
In fact,
1. the class of all languages is not countable, whereas
2. the class of all enumerable languages is countable.
The following statements are equivalent:
1. The language A is decidable.
2. Both A and its complement A are enumerable.
Complexity classes:
These classes of languages were considered in Chap-
ter 6.
1. The class P consists of all languages that can be decided in polynomial
time by a deterministic Turing machine.
2. The class NP consists of all languages that can be decided in poly-
nomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine. Equivalently, a
language A is in the class NP, if for every string w ∈A, there exists a
“solution” s, such that (i) the length of s is polynomial in the length
of w, and (ii) the correctness of s can be veriﬁed in polynomial time.
