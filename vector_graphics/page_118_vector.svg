• A →BB; we add the rule A →B, but not the rule A →ϵ (because it
has already been removed).
At this moment, we have the following grammar:
S
→
A|ϵ
A
→
BAB|B|BB|AB|BA|A
B
→
00
Since all ϵ-rules have been eliminated, this completes Step 2. (Observe that
the rule S →ϵ is allowed, because S is the start variable.)
Step 3: Eliminate all unit-rules.
We take the unit-rule A →A. We can remove this rule, without adding
any new rule. At this moment, we have the following grammar:
S
→
A|ϵ
A
→
BAB|B|BB|AB|BA
B
→
00
We take the unit-rule S →A, remove it, and add the rules
S →BAB|B|BB|AB|BA.
This gives the following grammar:
S
→
ϵ|BAB|B|BB|AB|BA
A
→
BAB|B|BB|AB|BA
B
→
00
We take the unit-rule S →B, remove it, and add the rule S →00. This
gives the following grammar:
S
→
ϵ|BAB|BB|AB|BA|00
A
→
BAB|B|BB|AB|BA
B
→
00
We take the unit-rule A →B, remove it, and add the rule A →00. This
gives the following grammar:
S
→
ϵ|BAB|BB|AB|BA|00
A
→
BAB|BB|AB|BA|00
B
→
