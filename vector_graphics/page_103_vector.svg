Examples of context-free grammars
95
By applying the rules in R, starting with the start variable S, we obtain,
for example,
S
⇒
SS
⇒
aSbS
⇒
aSbSS
⇒
aSSbSS
⇒
aaSbSbSS
⇒
aabSbSS
⇒
aabbSS
⇒
aabbaSbS
⇒
aabbabS
⇒
aabbabaSb
⇒
aabbabab
What is the language L(G) of this context-free grammar G? If we think
of a as being a left-parenthesis “(”, and of b as being a right-parenthesis “)”,
then L(G) is the language consisting of all strings of properly nested paren-
theses. Here is the explanation: Any string of properly nested parentheses is
either
• empty (which we derive from S by the rule S →ϵ),
• consists of a left-parenthesis, followed by an arbitrary string of properly
nested parentheses, followed by a right-parenthesis (these are derived
from S by ﬁrst applying the rule S →aSb), or
• consists of an arbitrary string of properly nested parentheses, followed
by an arbitrary string of properly nested parentheses (these are derived
from S by ﬁrst applying the rule S →SS).
3.2.2
A context-free grammar for a nonregular lan-
guage
Consider the language L1 = {0n1n : n ≥0}. We have seen in Section 2.9.1
that L1 is not a regular language. We claim that L1 is a context-free language.
