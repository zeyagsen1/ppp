Context-Free Languages
Theorem 3.7.3 Let Σ be an alphabet and let A ⊆Σ∗be a context-free lan-
guage. Then there exists a nondeterministic pushdown automaton that ac-
cepts A and has only one state.
Proof. Since A is context-free, there exists a context-free grammar G0 such
that L(G0) = A. By Theorem 3.4.2, there exists a context-free grammar G
that is in Chomsky normal form and for which L(G) = L(G0). The construc-
tion given above converts G to a nondeterministic pushdown automaton M
that has only one state and for which L(M) = L(G).

The pumping lemma for context-free lan-
guages
In Section 2.9, we proved the pumping lemma for regular languages and
used it to prove that certain languages are not regular. In this section, we
generalize the pumping lemma to context-free languages.
The idea is to
consider the parse tree (see Section 3.1) that describes the derivation of a
suﬃciently long string in the context-free language L. Since the number of
variables in the corresponding context-free grammar G is ﬁnite, there is at
least one variable, say Aj, that occurs more than once on the longest root-
to-leaf path in the parse tree. The subtree which is sandwiched between two
occurrences of Aj on this path can be copied any number of times. This will
result in a legal parse tree and, hence, in a “pumped” string that is in the
language L.
Theorem 3.8.1 (Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Languages) Let
L be a context-free language. Then there exists an integer p ≥1, called the
pumping length, such that the following holds: Every string s in L, with
|s| ≥p, can be written as s = uvxyz, such that
1. |vy| ≥1 (i.e., v and y are not both empty),
2. |vxy| ≤p, and
3. uvixyiz ∈L, for all i ≥0.
