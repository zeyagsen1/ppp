The pumping lemma and nonregular languages
73
Sixth example
Consider the language
A = {1n : n is a prime number}.
We prove by contradiction that A is not a regular language.
Assume that A is a regular language. Let p ≥1 be the pumping length,
as given by the pumping lemma. Let n ≥p be a prime number, and consider
the string s = 1n. Then s ∈A and |s| = n ≥p. By the pumping lemma, s
can be written as s = xyz, where y ̸= ϵ, |xy| ≤p, and xyiz ∈A for all i ≥0.
Let k be the integer such that y = 1k. Since y ̸= ϵ, we have k ≥1. For
each i ≥0, n + (i −1)k is a prime number, because xyiz = 1n+(i−1)k ∈A.
For i = n + 1, however, we have
n + (i −1)k = n + nk = n(1 + k),
which is not a prime number, because n ≥2 and 1 + k ≥2.
This is a
contradiction and, therefore, A is not a regular language.
Seventh example
Consider the language
A = {w ∈{0, 1}∗:
the number of occurrences of 01 in w is equal to
the number of occurrences of 10 in w }.
Since this language has the same ﬂavor as the one in the second example,
we may suspect that A is not a regular language. This is, however, not true:
As we will show, A is a regular language.
The key property is the following one: Let w be an arbitrary string in
{0, 1}∗. Then
the absolute value of the number of occurrences of 01 in w minus
the number of occurrences of 10 in w is at most one.
This property holds, because between any two consecutive occurrences of
01, there must be exactly one occurrence of 10. Similarly, between any two
consecutive occurrences of 10, there must be exactly one occurrence of 01.
We will construct a DFA that accepts A. This DFA uses the following
ﬁve states:
