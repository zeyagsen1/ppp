Chapter 7
Summary
We have seen several diﬀerent models for “processing” languages, i.e., pro-
cessing sets of strings over some ﬁnite alphabet. For each of these models,
we have asked the question which types of languages can be processed, and
which types of languages cannot be processed. In this ﬁnal chapter, we give
a brief summary of these results.
Regular languages:
This class of languages was considered in Chapter 2.
The following statements are equivalent:
1. The language A is regular, i.e., there exists a deterministic ﬁnite au-
tomaton that accepts A.
2. There exists a nondeterministic ﬁnite automaton that accepts A.
3. There exists a regular expression that describes A.
This claim was proved by the following conversions:
1. Every nondeterministic ﬁnite automaton can be converted to an equiv-
alent deterministic ﬁnite automaton.
2. Every deterministic ﬁnite automaton can be converted to an equivalent
regular expression.
3. Every regular expression can be converted to an equivalent nondeter-
ministic ﬁnite automaton.
