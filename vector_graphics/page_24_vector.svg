Introduction
It follows that 3n = 2m, which can be rewritten as m = 3n/2. Since m is an
integer, and since gcd(2, 3) = 1, n/2 must be an integer. Hence, n is even,
which is a contradiction.
Let Kn be the complete graph on n vertices. This graph has a vertex set
of size n, and every pair of distinct vertices is joined by an edge.
If G = (V, E) is a graph with n vertices, then the complement G of G is
the graph with vertex set V that consists of those edges of Kn that are not
present in G.
Theorem 1.3.15 Let n ≥2 and let G be a graph on n vertices. Then G is
connected or G is connected.
Proof. We prove the theorem by induction on the number n of vertices. For
the basis, assume that n = 2. There are two possibilities for the graph G:
1. G contains one edge. In this case, G is connected.
2. G does not contain an edge. In this case, the complement G contains
one edge and, therefore, G is connected.
So for n = 2, the theorem is true.
Let n ≥2 and assume that the theorem is true for every graph with n
vertices. Let G be graph with n + 1 vertices. We have to prove that G is
connected or G is connected. We consider three cases.
Case 1: There is a vertex v whose degree in G is equal to n.
Since G has n+1 vertices, v is connected by an edge to every other vertex
of G. Therefore, G is connected.
Case 2: There is a vertex v whose degree in G is equal to 0.
In this case, the degree of v in the graph G is equal to n. Since G has n+1
vertices, v is connected by an edge to every other vertex of G. Therefore, G
is connected.
Case 3: For every vertex v, the degree of v in G is in {1, 2, . . . , n −1}.
Let v be an arbitrary vertex of G.
Let G′ be the graph obtained by
deleting from G the vertex v, together with all edges that are incident on v.
Since G′ has n vertices, we know from the induction hypothesis that G′ is
connected or G′ is connected.
