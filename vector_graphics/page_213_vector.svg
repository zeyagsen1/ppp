Let us again consider the language kColor. Let G be a graph with vertex
set V = {1, 2, . . . , m} and edge set E, and let k be a positive integer. We
want to decide whether or not G is k-colorable. A “solution” is a coloring of
the nodes using at most k diﬀerent colors. That is, a solution is a sequence
f1, f2, . . . , fm. (Interpret this as: vertex i receives color fi, 1 ≤i ≤m). This
sequence is a correct solution if and only if
1. fi ∈{1, 2, . . . , k}, for all i with 1 ≤i ≤m, and
2. for all i with 1 ≤i ≤m, and for all j with 1 ≤j ≤m, if (i, j) ∈E,
then fi ̸= fj.
If someone gives us this solution (i.e., the sequence f1, f2, . . . , fm), then
we can verify in polynomial time whether or not these two conditions are
satisﬁed. The length of this solution is O(m log k): for each i, we need about
log k bits to represent fi. Hence, the length of the solution is polynomial in
the length of the input, i.e., it is polynomial in the number of bits needed to
represent the graph G and the number k.
For the Hamilton cycle problem, a solution consists of a sequence v1,
v2, . . . , vm of vertices. This sequence is a correct solution if and only if
1. {v1, v2, . . . , vm} = {1, 2, . . . , m} and
2. {(v1, v2), (v2, v3), . . . , (vm−1, vm), (vm, v1)} ⊆E.
These two conditions can be veriﬁed in polynomial time.
Moreover, the
length of the solution is polynomial in the length of the input graph.
Consider the sum of subset problem. A solution is a sequence c1, c2, . . . , cm.
It is a correct solution if and only if
1. ci ∈{0, 1}, for all i with 1 ≤i ≤m, and
2. Pm
i=1 ciai = b.
Hence, the set I ⊆{1, 2, . . . , m} in the deﬁnition of SOS is the set of indices
i for which ci = 1. Again, these two conditions can be veriﬁed in polynomial
time, and the length of the solution is polynomial in the length of the input.
Finally, let us consider the language NPrim. Let x ≥2 be an integer.
The integers a and b form a “solution” for x if and only if
