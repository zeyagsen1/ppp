members and two strings that are not members of the language described by
the expression. The alphabet is Σ = {a, b}.
1. a(ba)∗b.
2. (a ∪b)∗a(a ∪b)∗b(a ∪b)∗a(a ∪b)∗.
3. (a ∪ba ∪bb)(a ∪b)∗.
2.13 Give regular expressions describing the following languages.
In all
cases, the alphabet is {0, 1}.
1. {w : w contains at least three 1s}.
2. {w : w contains at least two 1s and at most one 0},
3. {w : w contains an even number of 0s and exactly two 1s}.
4. {w : w contains exactly two 0s and at least two 1s}.
5. {w : w contains an even number of 0s and each 0 is followed by at least one 1}.
6. {w : every odd position in w is 1}.
