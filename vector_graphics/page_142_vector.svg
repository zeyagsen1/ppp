Chapter 3.
Context-Free Languages
• Prove that the star A∗of A is also context-free.
3.5 Deﬁne the following two languages A and B:
A = {ambncn : m ≥0, n ≥0}
and
B = {ambmcn : m ≥0, n ≥0}.
• Prove that both A and B are context-free, by constructing two context-
free grammars, one that generates A and one that generates B.
• We have seen in Section 3.8.2 that the language
{anbncn : n ≥0}
is not context-free. Explain why this implies that the intersection of
two context-free languages is not necessarily context-free.
• Use De Morgan’s Law to conclude that the complement of a context-
free language is not necessarily context-free.
3.6 Let A be a context-free language and let B be a regular language.
• Prove that the intersection A ∩B of A and B is context-free.
• Prove that the set-diﬀerence
A \ B = {w : w ∈A, w ̸∈B}
of A and B is context-free.
• Is the set-diﬀerence of two context-free languages necessarily context-
free?
3.7 Let L be the language consisting of all non-empty strings w over the
alphabet {a, b} such that
• the number of as in w is equal to the number of bs in w,
• w does not contain the substring abba, and
• w does not contain the substring bbaa.
