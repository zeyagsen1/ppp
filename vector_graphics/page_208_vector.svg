Context-free languages
We have shown in Section 5.1.3 that every context-free language is decid-
able. The algorithm presented there, however, does not run in polynomial
time. Using a technique called dynamic programming (which you will learn
in COMP 3804), the following result can be shown:
Theorem 6.2.3 Let Σ be an alphabet, and let A ⊆Σ∗be a context-free
language. Then A ∈P.
Observe that, obviously, every language in P is decidable.
The 2-coloring problem
Let G be a graph with vertex set V and edge set E.
We say that G is
2-colorable, if it is possible to give each vertex of V a color such that
1. for each edge (u, v) ∈E, the vertices u and v have diﬀerent colors, and
2. only two colors are used to color all vertices.
See Figure 6.1 for two examples. We deﬁne the following language:
2Color := {⟨G⟩: the graph G is 2-colorable},
where ⟨G⟩denotes the binary string that encodes the graph G.
