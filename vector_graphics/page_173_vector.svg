Countable sets

In other words, if A is an inﬁnite and countable set, then there exists a
bijection f : N →A, and we can write A as
A = {f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4), . . .}.
Since f is a bijection, every element of A occurs exactly once in the set on
the right-hand side. This means that we can number the elements of A using
the positive integers: Every element of A receives a unique number.
Theorem 5.2.3 The following sets are countable:
1. The set Z of integers:
Z = {. . . , −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}.
2. The Cartesian product N × N:
N × N = {(m, n) : m ∈N, n ∈N}.
3. The set Q of rational numbers:
Q = {m/n : m ∈Z, n ∈Z, n ̸= 0}.
Proof. To prove that the set Z is countable, we have to give each element of
Z a unique number in N. We obtain this numbering, by listing the elements
of Z in the following order:
0, 1, −1, 2, −2, 3, −3, 4, −4, . . .
In this (inﬁnite) list, every element of Z occurs exactly once. The number of
an element of Z is given by its position in this list.
Formally, deﬁne the function f : N →Z by
f(n) =
 n/2
if n is even,
−(n −1)/2
if n is odd.
This function f is a bijection and, therefore, the sets N and Z have the same
size. Hence, the set Z is countable.
For the proofs of the other two claims, we refer to the course COMP 1805.
We now use Cantor’s Diagonalization principle to prove that the set of
real numbers is not countable:
