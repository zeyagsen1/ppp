Chapter 3.
Context-Free Languages
we can derive, from X, all binary strings. Thus, by combining these with
the rule
S3 →X10X,
we can derive, from S3, all strings of type 3.
We arrive at the context-free grammar G = (V, Σ, R, S), where V =
{S, S1, S2, S3, X}, Σ = {0, 1}, and R consists of the rules
S
→
S1|S2|S3
S1
→
1|S11|0S11
S2
→
0|0S2|0S21
S3
→
X10X
X
→
ϵ|0X|1X
To summarize, we have
S1
∗⇒0m1n, for all integers m and n with 0 ≤m < n,
S2
∗⇒0m1n, for all integers m and n with 0 ≤n < m,
X
∗⇒u, for each string u in {0, 1}∗,
and
S3
∗⇒w, for every binary string w that contains 10 as a substring.
From these observations, it follows that that L(G) = L.
3.2.4
A context-free grammar that veriﬁes addition
Consider the language
L = {anbmcn+m : n ≥0, m ≥0}.
Using the pumping lemma for regular languages (Theorem 2.9.1), it can
be shown that L is not a regular language. We will construct a context-
free grammar G whose language is equal to L, thereby proving that L is a
context-free language.
First observe that ϵ ∈L. Therefore, we will take S →ϵ to be one of the
rules in the grammar.
Let us see how we can derive all strings in L from the start variable S:
