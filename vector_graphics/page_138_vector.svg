Chapter 3.
Context-Free Languages
At this point, you should convince yourself that the two approaches above,
which showed that A is context-free, do not work for B. The reason why
they do not work is that the language B is not context-free, as we will prove
now.
Assume that B is a context-free language. Let p ≥1 be the pumping
length, as given by the pumping lemma. At this point, we must choose a
string s in B, whose length is at least p, and that does not satisfy the three
properties stated in the pumping lemma. Let us try the string s = apbapb.
Then s ∈B and |s| = 2p + 2 ≥p. Hence, by the pumping lemma, s can be
written as s = uvxyz, where (i) |vy| ≥1, (ii) |vxy| ≤p, and (iii) uvixyiz ∈B
for all i ≥0. It may happen that p ≥3, u = ap−1, v = a, x = b, y = a,
and z = ap−1b. If this is the case, then properties (i), (ii), and (iii) hold,
and, thus, we do not get a contradiction. In other words, we have chosen
the “wrong” string s. This string is “wrong”, because there is only one b
between the as. Because of this, v can be in the leftmost block of as, and
y can be in the rightmost block of as. Observe that if there were at least p
many bs between the as, then this would not happen, because |vxy| ≤p.
Based on the discussion above, we choose s = apbpapbp. Observe that
s ∈B and |s| = 4p ≥p. Hence, by the pumping lemma, s can be written as
s = uvxyz, where |vy| ≥1, |vxy| ≤p, and uvixyiz ∈B for all i ≥0. Based
on the location of vxy in the string s, we distinguish three cases:
Case 1: The substring vxy overlaps both the leftmost half and the rightmost
half of s.
Since |vxy| ≤p, the substring vxy is contained in the “middle” part of s,
i.e., vxy is contained in the block bpap. Consider the string uv0xy0z = uxz.
Since |vy| ≥1, we know that at least one of v and y is non-empty.
• If v ̸= ϵ, then v contains at least one b from the leftmost block of bs in
s, whereas y does not contain any b from the rightmost block of bs in s.
Therefore, in the string uxz, the leftmost block of bs contains fewer bs
than the rightmost block of bs. Hence, the string uxz is not contained
in B.
• If y ̸= ϵ, then y contains at least one a from the rightmost block of
as in s, whereas v does not contain any a from the leftmost block of
as in s. Therefore, in the string uxz, the leftmost block of as contains
more as than the rightmost block of as. Hence, the string uxz is not
contained in B.
