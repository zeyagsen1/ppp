Finite Automata and Regular Languages
Fourth example
Consider the language
A = {0m1n : m > n ≥0}.
We prove by contradiction that A is not a regular language.
Assume that A is a regular language. Let p ≥1 be the pumping length,
as given by the pumping lemma. Consider the string s = 0p+11p. Then s ∈A
and |s| = 2p + 1 ≥p. By the pumping lemma, s can be written as s = xyz,
where y ̸= ϵ, |xy| ≤p, and xyiz ∈A for all i ≥0.
Since |xy| ≤p, the string y contains only 0s. Since y ̸= ϵ, y contains at
least one 0. Consider the string xy0z = xz. The number of 1s in this string
is equal to p, whereas the number of 0s is at most equal to p. Therefore, the
string xy0z is not contained in A. But, by the pumping lemma, this string
is contained in A. This is a contradiction and, therefore, A is not a regular
language.
Fifth example
Consider the language
A = {1n2 : n ≥0}.
We prove by contradiction that A is not a regular language.
Assume that A is a regular language. Let p ≥1 be the pumping length,
as given by the pumping lemma. Consider the string s = 1p2. Then s ∈A
and |s| = p2 ≥p. By the pumping lemma, s can be written as s = xyz,
where y ̸= ϵ, |xy| ≤p, and xyiz ∈A for all i ≥0.
Observe that
|s| = |xyz| = p2
and
|xy2z| = |xyyz| = |xyz| + |y| = p2 + |y|.
Since |xy| ≤p, we have |y| ≤p. Since y ̸= ϵ, we have |y| ≥1. It follows that
p2 < |xy2z| ≤p2 + p < (p + 1)2.
Hence, the length of the string xy2z is strictly between two consecutive
squares.
It follows that this length is not a square and, therefore, xy2z
is not contained in A. But, by the pumping lemma, this string is contained
in A. This is a contradiction and, therefore, A is not a regular language.
