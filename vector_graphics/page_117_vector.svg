3.4.1
An example
Consider the context-free grammar G = (V, Σ, R, A), where V = {A, B},
Σ = {0, 1}, A is the start variable, and R consists of the rules
A
→
BAB|B|ϵ
B
→
00|ϵ
We apply the construction given in the proof of Theorem 3.4.2 to convert
this grammar to a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form whose
language is the same as that of G. Throughout the construction, upper case
letters will denote variables.
Step 1: Eliminate the start variable from the right-hand side of the rules.
We introduce a new start variable S, and add the rule S →A. This gives
the following grammar:
S
→
A
A
→
BAB|B|ϵ
B
→
00|ϵ
Step 2: Eliminate all ϵ-rules.
We take the ϵ-rule A →ϵ, and remove it. Then we consider all rules that
contain A on the right-hand side. There are two such rules:
• S →A; we add the rule S →ϵ;
• A →BAB; we add the rule A →BB.
This gives the following grammar:
S
→
A|ϵ
A
→
BAB|B|BB
B
→
00|ϵ
We take the ϵ-rule B →ϵ, and remove it. Then we consider all rules that
contain B on the right-hand side. There are three such rules:
• A →BAB; we add the rules A →AB, A →BA, and A →A;
• A →B; we do not add the rule A →ϵ, because it has already been
removed;
