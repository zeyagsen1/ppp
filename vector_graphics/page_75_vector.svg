Equivalence of regular expressions and regular languages 67
Lemma 2.8.3 Let n ≥1 be an integer and, for 1 ≤i ≤n and 1 ≤j ≤n,
let Bij and Ci be regular expressions such that ϵ ̸∈Bij. Let L1, L2, . . . , Ln be
languages that satisfy
Li =
 n[
j=1
BijLj
!
∪Ci for 1 ≤i ≤n.
Then L1 can be expressed as a regular expression only involving the regular
expressions Bij and Ci.
Proof. The proof is by induction on n. The base case is when n = 1. In
this case, we have
L1 = B11L1 ∪C1.
Since ϵ ̸∈B11, it follows from Lemma 2.8.2 that L1 = B∗
11C1. This proves
the base case.
Let n ≥2 and assume the lemma is true for n −1. We have

By substituting this equation for Ln into the equations for Li, 1 ≤i ≤n −1,
