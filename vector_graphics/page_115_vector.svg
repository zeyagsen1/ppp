where A1, A2, . . . , Ak−2 are new variables that are added to the current
set V3.
Observe that in this way, we replace the one-step derivation A ⇒
u1u2 . . . uk by the (k −1)-step derivation
A ⇒u1A1 ⇒u1u2A2 ⇒. . . ⇒u1u2 . . . uk−2Ak−2 ⇒u1u2 . . . uk.
Let R4 be the set of rules, and let V4 be the set of variables, after all rules
with more than two symbols on the right-hand side have been eliminated. We
deﬁne G4 = (V4, Σ, R4, S4), where S4 = S3. This grammar has the property
that
• the start variable S4 does not occur on the right-hand side of any rule
in R4,
• R4 does not contain any ϵ-rule (it may contain the rule S4 →ϵ),
• R4 does not contain any unit-rule,
• R4 does not contain any rule with more than two symbols on the right-
hand side, and
• L(G4) = L(G3) = L(G2) = L(G1) = L(G).
Step 5: Eliminate all rules of the form A →u1u2, where u1 and u2 are not
both variables.
For each rule in the current set R4 that is of the form A →u1u2, where
u1 and u2 are elements of V4 ∪Σ, but u1 and u2 are not both contained in
V4, we modify G3 as follows:
1. If u1 ∈Σ and u2 ∈V4, then replace the rule A →u1u2 in the current
set R4 by the two rules A →U1u2 and U1 →u1, where U1 is a new
variable that is added to the current set V4.
Observe that in this way, we replace the one-step derivation A ⇒u1u2
by the two-step derivation A ⇒U1u2 ⇒u1u2.
2. If u1 ∈V4 and u2 ∈Σ, then replace the rule A →u1u2 in the current
set R4 by the two rules A →u1U2 and U2 →u2, where U2 is a new
variable that is added to the current set V4.
Observe that in this way, we replace the one-step derivation A ⇒u1u2
by the two-step derivation A ⇒u1U2 ⇒u1u2.
