8. If A and B are two sets, then
(a) their union is deﬁned as
A ∪B = {x : x ∈A or x ∈B},
(b) their intersection is deﬁned as
A ∩B = {x : x ∈A and x ∈B},
(c) their diﬀerence is deﬁned as
A \ B = {x : x ∈A and x ̸∈B},
(d) the Cartesian product of A and B is deﬁned as
A × B = {(x, y) : x ∈A and y ∈B},
(e) the complement of A is deﬁned as
A = {x : x ̸∈A}.
9. A binary relation on two sets A and B is a subset of A × B.
10. A function f from A to B, denoted by f : A →B, is a binary relation
R, having the property that for each element a ∈A, there is exactly
one ordered pair in R, whose ﬁrst component is a. We will also say
that f(a) = b, or f maps a to b, or the image of a under f is b. The
set A is called the domain of f, and the set
{b ∈B : there is an a ∈A with f(a) = b}
is called the range of f.
11. A function f : A →B is one-to-one (or injective), if for any two distinct
elements a and a′ in A, we have f(a) ̸= f(a′). The function f is onto
(or surjective), if for each element b ∈B, there exists an element a ∈A,
such that f(a) = b; in other words, the range of f is equal to the set
B. A function f is a bijection, if f is both injective and surjective.
12. A binary relation R ⊆A × A is an equivalence relation, if it satisﬁes
the following three conditions:
