Theorem 1.3.13 Let G = (V, E) be a graph with m edges. Then the sum
of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges, i.e.,
X
v∈V
deg(v) = 2m.
Proof. The proof is by induction on the number m of edges. For the basis of
the induction, assume that m = 0. Then the graph G does not contain any
edges and, therefore, P
v∈V deg(v) = 0. Thus, the theorem is true if m = 0.
Let m ≥0 and assume that the theorem is true for every graph with m
edges. Let G be an arbitrary graph with m+1 edges. We have to prove that
P
v∈V deg(v) = 2(m + 1).
Let {a, b} be an arbitrary edge in G, and let G′ be the graph obtained
from G by removing the edge {a, b}. Since G′ has m edges, we know from
the induction hypothesis that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in G′ is
equal to 2m. Using this, we obtain
X
v∈G
deg(v) =
X
v∈G′
deg(v) + 2 = 2m + 2 = 2(m + 1).

Recall Theorem 1.3.5, which states that for every even integer n ≥4, there
exists a 3-regular graph with n vertices. The following theorem explains why
we stated this theorem for even values of n.
Theorem 1.3.14 Let n ≥5 be an odd integer. There is no 3-regular graph
with n vertices.
Proof. The proof is by contradiction. So we assume that there exists a
graph G = (V, E) with n vertices that is 3-regular. Let m be the number of
edges in G. Since deg(v) = 3 for every vertex, we have
X
v∈V
deg(v) = 3n.
On the other hand, by Theorem 1.3.3, we have
X
v∈V
deg(v) = 2m.
