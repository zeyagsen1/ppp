Proof. An odd positive integer n can be written as n = 2k + 1, for some
integer k ≥0. Then
n2 = (2k + 1)2 = 4k2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k2 + 2k) + 1.
Since 2(2k2 + 2k) is even, and “even plus one is odd”, we can conclude that
n2 is odd.
Theorem 1.3.2 Let G = (V, E) be a graph. Then the sum of the degrees of
all vertices is an even integer, i.e.,
X
v∈V
deg(v)
is even.
Proof. If you do not see the meaning of this statement, then ﬁrst try it out
for a few graphs. The reason why the statement holds is very simple: Each
edge contributes 2 to the summation (because an edge is incident on exactly
two distinct vertices).
Actually, the proof above proves the following theorem.
Theorem 1.3.3 Let G = (V, E) be a graph. Then the sum of the degrees of
all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges, i.e.,
X
v∈V
deg(v) = 2|E|.

Constructive proofs
This technique not only shows the existence of a certain object, it actually
gives a method of creating it. Here is how a constructive proof looks like:
Theorem 1.3.4 There exists an object with property P.
Proof. Here is the object: [. . .]
And here is the proof that the object satisﬁes property P: [. . .]
Here is an example of a constructive proof. A graph is called 3-regular, if
each vertex has degree three.
