Step 2: An ϵ-rule is a rule that is of the form A →ϵ, where A is a variable
that is not equal to the start variable. In the second step, we eliminate all
ϵ-rules from G1.
We consider all ϵ-rules, one after another. Let A →ϵ be one such rule,
where A ∈V1 and A ̸= S1. We modify G1 as follows:
1. Remove the rule A →ϵ from the current set R1.
2. For each rule in the current set R1 that is of the form
(a) B →A, add the rule B →ϵ to R1, unless this rule has already
been deleted from R1; observe that in this way, we replace the two-
step derivation B ⇒A ⇒ϵ by the one-step derivation B ⇒ϵ;
(b) B →uAv (where u and v are strings that are not both empty),
add the rule B →uv to R1; observe that in this way, we replace
the two-step derivation B ⇒uAv ⇒uv by the one-step derivation
B ⇒uv;
(c) B →uAvAw (where u, v, and w are strings), add the rules B →
uvw, B →uAvw, and B →uvAw to R1; if u = v = w = ϵ and
the rule B →ϵ has already been deleted from R1, then we do not
add the rule B →ϵ;
(d) treat rules in which A occurs more than twice on the right-hand
side in a similar fashion.
We repeat this process until all ϵ-rules have been eliminated.
Let R2
be the set of rules, after all ϵ-rules have been eliminated. We deﬁne G2 =
(V2, Σ, R2, S2), where V2 = V1 and S2 = S1. This grammar has the property
that
• the start variable S2 does not occur on the right-hand side of any rule
in R2,
• R2 does not contain any ϵ-rule (it may contain the rule S2 →ϵ), and
• L(G2) = L(G1) = L(G).
Step 3: A unit-rule is a rule that is of the form A →B, where A and B are
variables. In the third step, we eliminate all unit-rules from G2.
