if r = q0 and a ̸= ϵ.
Theorem 2.6.2 The set of regular languages is closed under the concatena-
tion operation, i.e., if A1 and A2 are regular languages over the same alphabet
Σ, then A1A2 is also a regular language.
Proof.
Let M1 = (Q1, Σ, δ1, q1, F1) be an NFA, such that A1 = L(M1).
Similarly, let M2 = (Q2, Σ, δ2, q2, F2) be an NFA, such that A2 = L(M2).
As in the proof of Theorem 2.6.1, we may assume that Q1 ∩Q2 = ∅. We
will construct an NFA M = (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F), such that L(M) = A1A2. The
construction is illustrated in Figure 2.2. The NFA M is deﬁned as follows:
1. Q = Q1 ∪Q2.
2. q0 = q1.
3. F = F2.
4. δ : Q × Σϵ →P(Q) is deﬁned as follows: For any r ∈Q and for any
a ∈Σϵ,
δ(r, a) =







δ1(r, a)
if r ∈Q1 and r ̸∈F1,
δ1(r, a)
if r ∈F1 and a ̸= ϵ,
δ1(r, a) ∪{q2}
if r ∈F1 and a = ϵ,
δ2(r, a)
if r ∈Q2.
Theorem 2.6.3 The set of regular languages is closed under the star oper-
ation, i.e., if A is a regular language, then A∗is also a regular language.
