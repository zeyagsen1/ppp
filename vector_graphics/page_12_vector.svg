Introduction
5. This theory simpliﬁes the complex computers to an abstract and simple
mathematical model, and helps you to understand them better.
6. This course is about rigorously analyzing capabilities and limitations
of systems.
Where does this course ﬁt in the Computer Science Curriculum at Car-
leton University? It is a theory course that is the third part in the series
COMP 1805, COMP 2804, COMP 3803, COMP 3804, and COMP 4804.
This course also widens your understanding of computers and will inﬂuence
other courses including Compilers, Programming Languages, and Artiﬁcial
Intelligence.
1.2
Mathematical preliminaries
Throughout this course, we will assume that you know the following mathe-
matical concepts:
1. A set is a collection of well-deﬁned objects. Examples are (i) the set of
all Dutch Olympic Gold Medallists, (ii) the set of all pubs in Ottawa,
and (iii) the set of all even natural numbers.
2. The set of natural numbers is N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}.
3. The set of integers is Z = {. . . , −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}.
4. The set of rational numbers is Q = {m/n : m ∈Z, n ∈Z, n ̸= 0}.
5. The set of real numbers is denoted by R.
6. If A and B are sets, then A is a subset of B, written as A ⊆B, if every
element of A is also an element of B. For example, the set of even
natural numbers is a subset of the set of all natural numbers. Every
set A is a subset of itself, i.e., A ⊆A. The empty set is a subset of
every set A, i.e., ∅⊆A.
7. If B is a set, then the power set P(B) of B is deﬁned to be the set of
all subsets of B:
P(B) = {A : A ⊆B}.
Observe that ∅∈P(B) and B ∈P(B).
