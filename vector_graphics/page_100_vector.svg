2. Take any variable in the current string and take any rule that has this
variable on the left-hand side. Then, in the current string, replace this
variable by the right-hand side of the rule.
3. Repeat 2. until the current string only contains terminals.

S
⇒
AB
⇒
aAB
⇒
aAbB
⇒
aaAbB
⇒
aaaAbB
⇒
aaaabB
⇒
aaaabb
This derivation can also be represented using a parse tree, as in the ﬁgure
below:
S
A

The ﬁve rules in this example constitute a context-free grammar. The
language of this grammar is the set of all strings that
