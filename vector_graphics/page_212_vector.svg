k ≥3, it is not known whether or not kColor is in the class P.
Example 6.3.2 Let G be a graph with vertex set V = {1, 2, . . . , m} and
edge set E. A Hamilton cycle is a cycle in G that visits each vertex exactly
once. Formally, it is a sequence v1, v2, . . . , vm of vertices such that
1. {v1, v2, . . . , vm} = V , and
2. {(v1, v2), (v2, v3), . . . , (vm−1, vm), (vm, v1)} ⊆E.
We deﬁne the following language:
HC := {⟨G⟩: the graph G contains a Hamilton cycle}.
It is not known whether or not HC is in the class P.
Example 6.3.3 The sum of subset language is deﬁned as follows:
SOS := {⟨a1, a2, . . . , am, b⟩:
m, a1, a2, . . . , am, b ∈N0 and
∃I ⊆{1, 2, . . . , m}, P
i∈I ai = b}.
Also in this case, no polynomial-time algorithm is known that decides the
language SOS. That is, it is not known whether or not SOS is in the class
P.
Example 6.3.4 An integer x ≥2 is a prime number, if there are no a, b ∈N
such that a ̸= x, b ̸= x, and x = ab. Hence, the language of all non-primes
that are greater than or equal to two, is
NPrim := {⟨x⟩: x ≥2 and x is not a prime number}.
It is not obvious at all, whether or not NPrim is in the class P. In fact, it
was shown only in 2002 that NPrim is in the class P.
Observation 6.3.5 The four languages above have the following in com-
mon: If someone gives us a “solution” for any given input, then we can
easily, i.e., in polynomial time, verify whether or not this “solution” is a cor-
rect solution. Moreover, for any input to each of these four problems, there
exists a “solution” whose length is polynomial in the length of the input.
