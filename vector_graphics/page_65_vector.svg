We will not present the (boring) proofs of these identities, but urge you
to convince yourself informally that they make perfect sense. To give an
example, we mentioned above that
(0 ∪ϵ)1∗= 01∗∪1∗.
We can verify this identity in the following way:
(0 ∪ϵ)1∗
=
01∗∪ϵ1∗
(by identity 7)
=
01∗∪1∗
(by identity 2)
2.8
Equivalence of regular expressions and reg-
ular languages
In the beginning of Section 2.7, we mentioned the following result:
Theorem 2.8.1 Let L be a language. Then L is regular if and only if there
exists a regular expression that describes L.
The proof of this theorem consists of two parts:
• In Section 2.8.1, we will prove that every regular expression describes
a regular language.
• In Section 2.8.2, we will prove that every DFA M can be converted to
a regular expression that describes the language L(M).
These two results will prove Theorem 2.8.1.
