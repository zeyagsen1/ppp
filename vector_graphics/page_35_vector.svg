number of states. But, the deﬁnition of ﬁnite automaton requires the number
of states to be ﬁnite.
A better, and correct approach, is to keep track of whether the number
of 1s read so far is even or odd. This leads to the following ﬁnite automaton:
• The set of states is Q = {qe, qo}. If the ﬁnite automaton is in state qe,
then it has read an even number of 1s; if it is in state qo, then it has
read an odd number of 1s.
• The alphabet is Σ = {0, 1}.
• The start state is qe, because at the start, the number of 1s read by the
automaton is equal to 0, and 0 is even.
• The set F of accept states is F = {qo}.
• The transition function δ is given by the following table:

This ﬁnite automaton M = (Q, Σ, δ, qe, F) can also be described by its state
diagram, which is given in the ﬁgure below. The arrow that comes “out of
the blue” and enters the state qe, indicates that qe is the start state. The
state depicted with double circles indicates the accept state.

We have constructed a ﬁnite automaton M that accepts the language A.
Therefore, A is a regular language.
