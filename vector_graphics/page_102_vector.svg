Chapter 3.
Context-Free Languages
1. u = v or
2. there exist an integer k ≥2 and a sequence u1, u2, . . . , uk of strings in
(V ∪Σ)∗, such that
(a) u = u1,
(b) v = uk, and
(c) u1 ⇒u2 ⇒. . . ⇒uk.
In other words, by starting with the string u and applying rules zero or
more times, we obtain the string v. In our example, we see that aaAbB
∗⇒
aaaabbbB.
Deﬁnition 3.1.4 Let G = (V, Σ, R, S) be a context-free grammar.
The
language of G is deﬁned to be the set of all strings in Σ∗that can be derived
from the start variable S:
L(G) = {w ∈Σ∗: S
∗⇒w}.
Deﬁnition 3.1.5 A language L is called context-free, if there exists a context-
free grammar G such that L(G) = L.
3.2
Examples of context-free grammars
3.2.1
Properly nested parentheses
Consider the context-free grammar G = (V, Σ, R, S), where V = {S}, Σ =
{a, b}, and
R = {S →ϵ, S →aSb, S →SS}.
We write the three rules in R as
S →ϵ|aSb|SS,
where you can think of “|” as being a short-hand for “or”.
