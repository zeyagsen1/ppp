n-th iteration of the while-loop and the i-th iteration of the for-loop. In this
iteration, M accepts si = w in m ≤n steps and, therefore, w is sent to the
printer.

Most languages are not enumerable
In this section, we will prove that most languages are not enumerable. The
proof is based on the following two facts:
• The set consisting of all enumerable languages is countable; we will
prove this in Section 5.6.1.
• The set consisting of all languages is not countable; we will prove this
in Section 5.6.2.
5.6.1
The set of enumerable languages is countable
We deﬁne the set E as
E = {A : A ⊆{0, 1}∗is an enumerable language}.
In words, E is the set whose elements are the enumerable languages. Every
element of E is an enumerable language. Hence, every element of the set E
is itself a set consisting of strings.
Lemma 5.6.1 The set E is countable.
Proof. Let A ⊆{0, 1}∗be an enumerable language. There exists a Turing
machine TA that satisﬁes the conditions in Deﬁnition 5.4.1.
This Turing
machine TA can be uniquely speciﬁed by a string in English. This string can
be converted to a binary string sA. Hence, the binary string sA is a unique
encoding of the Turing machine TA.
Consider the set
S = {sA : A ⊆{0, 1}∗is an enumerable language}.
Observe that the function f : E →S, deﬁned by f(A) = sA for each A ∈E,
is a bijection. Therefore, the sets E and S have the same size. Hence, in
order to prove that the set E is countable, it is suﬃcient to prove that the
set S is countable.
