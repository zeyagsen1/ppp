Higman’s Theorem

it follows that
M ≡C + B · 2|z| + A · 2|z|+|y|
(mod N).
This, together with (2.4), implies that
M ≡0
(mod N),
i.e., N divides M. Since M > N, we conclude that M is not a prime number,
which is a contradiction. Thus, the language L is not regular.

Higman’s Theorem
Let Σ be a ﬁnite alphabet. For any two strings x and y in Σ∗, we say that x
is a subsequence of y, if x can be obtained by deleting zero or more symbols
from y. For example, 10110 is a subsequence of 0010010101010001. For any
language L ⊆Σ∗, we deﬁne
SUBSEQ(L) := {x : there exists a y ∈L such that x is a subsequence of y}.
That is, SUBSEQ(L) is the language consisting of the subsequences of all
strings in L. In 1952, Higman proved the following result:
Theorem 2.10.1 (Higman) For any ﬁnite alphabet Σ and for any lan-
guage L ⊆Σ∗, the language SUBSEQ(L) is regular.

Dickson’s Theorem
Our proof of Higman’s Theorem will use a theorem that was proved in 1913
by Dickson.
Recall that N denotes the set of positive integers. Let n ∈N. For any
two points p = (p1, p2, . . . , pn) and q = (q1, q2, . . . , qn) in Nn, we say that p is
dominated by q, if pi ≤qi for all i with 1 ≤i ≤n.
Theorem 2.10.2 (Dickson) Let S ⊆Nn, and let M be the set consisting of
all elements of S that are minimal in the relation “is dominated by”. Thus,
M = {q ∈S : there is no p in S \ {q} such that p is dominated by q}.
Then, the set M is ﬁnite.
