where every element of B occurs exactly once in the set on the right-hand
side.
We deﬁne the inﬁnite binary sequence w = w1w2w3 . . ., where, for each
integer n ≥1,
wn =
 1
if the n-th bit of f(n) is 0,
0
if the n-th bit of f(n) is 1.
Since w ∈B, it follows from (5.3) that there is an element n ∈N, such that
f(n) = w. Hence, the n-th bits of f(n) and w are equal. But, by deﬁnition,
these n-th bits are not equal. This is a contradiction and, therefore, the set
B is not countable.
In the rest of the proof, we will show that the sets L and B have the same
size. Since B is not countable, this will imply that L is not countable.
In order to prove that L and B have the same size, we have to show that
there exists a bijection
g : L →B.
We ﬁrst observe that the set {0, 1}∗is countable, because for each integer
n ≥0, there are only ﬁnitely many (to be precise, exactly 2n) binary strings
of length n. In fact, we can write
{0, 1}∗= {ϵ, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, 010, 100, 011, 101, 110, 111, . . .}.
For each integer n ≥1, we denote by sn the n-th string in this list. Hence,
{0, 1}∗= {s1, s2, s3, . . .}.
(5.4)
Now we are ready to deﬁne the bijection g : L →B: Let A ∈L, i.e.,
A ⊆{0, 1}∗is a language. We deﬁne the inﬁnite binary sequence g(A) as
follows: For each integer n ≥1, the n-th bit of g(A) is equal to
 1
if sn ∈A,
0
if sn ̸∈A.
In words, the inﬁnite binary sequence g(A) contains a 1 exactly in those
positions n for which the string sn in (5.4) is in the language A.
To give an example, assume that A is the language consisting of all binary
strings that start with 0. The following table gives the corresponding inﬁnite
binary sequence g(A) (this sequence is obtained by reading the rightmost
column from top to bottom):
