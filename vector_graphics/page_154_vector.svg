Chapter 4.
Turing Machines and the Church-Turing Thesis
For Stage 1, we use the following states:
q0 :
start state; tape head is on the leftmost symbol
qa :
leftmost a has been deleted; have not read b
qb :
leftmost b has been deleted; have not read c
qc :
leftmost c has been read; tape head moves to the right
q′
c :
tape head is on the rightmost c
q1 :
rightmost c has been deleted; tape head is on the rightmost
symbol or 2
qaccept :
accept state
qreject :
reject state
The transitions for Stage 1 are speciﬁed by the following instructions:
q0a →qa2R
qaa →qaaR
q0b →qreject
qab →qb2R
q0c →qreject
qac →qreject
q02 →qaccept
qa2 →qreject
qba →qreject
qca →qreject
qbb →qbbR
qcb →qreject
qbc →qccR
qcc →qccR
qb2 →qreject
qc2 →q′
c2L
q′
cc →q12L
For Stage 2, we use the following states:
q1 :
as above; tape head is on the rightmost symbol or on 2
qc :
copy c one cell to the left
qb :
copy b one cell to the left
q2 :
done with shifting; head moves to the left
Additionally, we use a state q′
1 which has the following meaning: If the input
string is of the form aibc, for some i ≥1, then after Stage 1, the tape contains
the string ai−122, the tape head is on the 2 immediately to the right of the
as, and the Turing machine is in state q1. In this case, we move one cell to
the left; if we then read 2, then i = 1, and we accept; otherwise, we read a,
and we reject.
