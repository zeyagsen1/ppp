Strings with b in the middle
We will construct a nondeterministic pushdown automaton that accepts the
set L of all strings in {a, b}∗having an odd length and whose middle symbol
is b, i.e.,
L = {vbw : v ∈{a, b}∗, w ∈{a, b}∗, |v| = |w|}.
The idea is as follows. The automaton uses two states q and q′, where q
is the start state. These states have the following meaning:
• If the automaton is in state q, then it has not reached the middle symbol
b of the input string.
• If the automaton is in state q′, then it has read the middle symbol b.
Observe that since the automaton can only make one single pass over the
input string, it has to “guess” (i.e., use nondeterminism) when it reaches the
middle of the string.
• If the automaton is in state q, then, when reading the current tape
symbol,
– it either pushes one symbol S onto the stack and stays in state q
– or, in case the current tape symbol is b, it “guesses” that it has
reached the middle of the input string, by switching to state q′.
• If the automaton is in state q′, then, when reading the current tape
symbol, it pops the top symbol S from the stack and stays in state q′.
