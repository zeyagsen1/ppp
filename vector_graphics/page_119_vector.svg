Since all unit-rules have been eliminated, this concludes Step 3.
Step 4: Eliminate all rules having more than two symbols on the right-hand
side. There are two such rules:
• We take the rule S →BAB, remove it, and add the rules S →BA1
and A1 →AB.
• We take the rule A →BAB, remove it, and add the rules A →BA2
and A2 →AB.
This gives the following grammar:
S
→
ϵ|BB|AB|BA|00|BA1
A
→
BB|AB|BA|00|BA2
B
→
00
A1
→
AB
A2
→
AB
Step 4 is now completed.
Step 5: Eliminate all rules, whose right-hand side contains exactly two
symbols, which are not both variables. There are three such rules:
• We replace the rule S →00 by the rules S →A3A3 and A3 →0.
• We replace the rule A →00 by the rules A →A4A4 and A4 →0.
• We replace the rule B →00 by the rules B →A5A5 and A5 →0.
This gives the following grammar, which is in Chomsky normal form:
S
→
ϵ|BB|AB|BA|BA1|A3A3
A
→
BB|AB|BA|BA2|A4A4
B
→
A5A5
A1
→
AB
A2
→
AB
A3
→
0
A4
→
0
A5
→
0
