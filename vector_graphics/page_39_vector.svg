Regular operations
In this section, we deﬁne three operations on languages. Later, we will answer
the question whether the set of all regular languages is closed under these
operations. Let A and B be two languages over the same alphabet.
1. The union of A and B is deﬁned as
A ∪B = {w : w ∈A or w ∈B}.
2. The concatenation of A and B is deﬁned as
AB = {ww′ : w ∈A and w′ ∈B}.
In words, AB is the set of all strings obtained by taking an arbitrary
string w in A and an arbitrary string w′ in B, and gluing them together
(such that w is to the left of w′).
3. The star of A is deﬁned as
A∗= {u1u2 . . . uk : k ≥0 and ui ∈A for all i = 1, 2, . . . , k}.
In words, A∗is obtained by taking any ﬁnite number of strings in A, and
gluing them together. Observe that k = 0 is allowed; this corresponds
to the empty string ϵ. Thus, ϵ ∈A∗.
To give an example, let A = {0, 01} and B = {1, 10}. Then
A ∪B = {0, 01, 1, 10},
AB = {01, 010, 011, 0110},
and
A∗= {ϵ, 0, 01, 00, 001, 010, 0101, 000, 0001, 00101, . . .}.
As another example, if Σ = {0, 1}, then Σ∗is the set of all binary strings
(including the empty string). Observe that a string always has a ﬁnite length.
Before we proceed, we give an alternative (and equivalent) deﬁnition of
the star of the language A: Deﬁne
A0 = {ϵ}
