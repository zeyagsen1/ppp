In this exercise, you will prove that L is context-free.
Let A be the language consisting of all non-empty strings w over the
alphabet {a, b} such that the number of as in w is equal to the number of bs
in w. In Exercise 3.3, you have shown that A is context-free.
Let B be the language consisting of all strings w over the alphabet {a, b}
such that
• w does not contain the substring abba, and
• w does not contain the substring bbaa.
1. Give a regular expression that describes the complement of B.
2. Argue that B is a regular language.
3. Use Exercise 3.6 to argue that L is a context-free language.
3.8 Construct (deterministic or nondeterministic) pushdown automata that
accept the following languages.
1. {02n1n : n ≥0}.
2. {0n1m0n : n ≥1, m ≥1}.
3. {w ∈{0, 1}∗: w contains more 1s than 0s}.
4. {wwR : w ∈{0, 1}∗}.
(If w = w1 . . . wn, then wR = wn . . . w1.)
5. {w ∈{0, 1}∗: w is a palindrome}.
3.9 Let L be the language
L = {ambn : 0 ≤m ≤n ≤2m}.
1. Prove that L is context-free, by constructing a context-free grammar
whose language is equal to L.
2. Prove that L is context-free, by constructing a nondeterministic push-
down automaton that accepts L.
3.10 Prove that the following languages are not context-free.
