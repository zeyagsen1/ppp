Lemma 2.10.8 For each b ∈{0, 1} and each 0 ≤k ≤n, the set Mbk is
ﬁnite.
Proof. Again, we will prove the claim by means of an example. Assume
that b = 1 and k = 3. Any string in Fbk can be written as 1a0b1c0d, for some
integers a, b, c, d ≥1. Consider the function ϕ : Fbk →N4 that is deﬁned by
ϕ(1a0b1c0d) = (a, b, c, d). Then, ϕ is an injective function, and the following
is true, for any two strings x and x′ in Fbk:
x is a subsequence of x′ if and only if ϕ(x) is dominated by ϕ(x′).
It follows that the elements of Mbk are in one-to-one correspondence with
those elements of ϕ(Fbk) that are minimal in the relation “is dominated by”.
The lemma thus follows from Dickson’s Theorem.
Now we can complete the proof of Higman’s Theorem:
• It follows from (2.9) and Lemmas 2.10.7 and 2.10.8, that Fbk is the
union of ﬁnitely many regular languages. Therefore, by Theorem 2.3.1,
Fbk is a regular language.
• It follows from (2.8) that A∩SUBSEQ(L) is the union of ﬁnitely many
regular languages. Therefore, again by Theorem 2.3.1, A∩SUBSEQ(L)
is a regular language.
• Since A ∩SUBSEQ(L) is regular and, by Lemma 2.10.6, A is regular,
it follows from Lemma 2.10.5 that SUBSEQ(L) is the union of two reg-
ular languages. Therefore, by Theorem 2.3.1, SUBSEQ(L) is a regular
language.
• Since SUBSEQ(L) is regular, it follows from Theorem 2.6.4 that the
language SUBSEQ(L) is regular as well.
