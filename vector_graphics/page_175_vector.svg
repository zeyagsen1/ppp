Countable sets

Since f(n) and x are equal, their n-th digits must be equal, i.e., dnn = dn.
But, by the deﬁnition of dn, we have dnn ̸= dn. This is a contradiction and,
therefore, the set A is not countable.
Notice how we deﬁned the real number x: For each n ≥1, the n-th digit
of x is not equal to the n-th digit of f(n). Therefore, for each n ≥1, x ̸= f(n)
and, thus, x ̸∈A.
The ﬁnal result of this section is the fact that for every set A, its power
set
P(A) = {B : B ⊆A}
is “strictly larger” than A. Deﬁne the function f : A →P(A) by
f(a) = {a},
for any a in A. Since f is one-to-one, we can say that P(A) is “at least as
large as” A.
Theorem 5.2.5 Let A be an arbitrary set. Then A and P(A) do not have
the same size.
Proof. The proof is by contradiction. Thus, we assume that there exists a
bijection g : A →P(A). Deﬁne the set B as
B = {a ∈A : a ̸∈g(a)}.
Since B ∈P(A) and g is a bijection, there exists an element a in A such that
g(a) = B.
First assume that a ∈B. Since g(a) = B, we have a ∈g(a). But then,
from the deﬁnition of the set B, we have a ̸∈B, which is a contradiction.
Next assume that a ̸∈B.
Since g(a) = B, we have a ̸∈g(a).
But
then, from the deﬁnition of the set B, we have a ∈B, which is again a
contradiction.
We conclude that the bijection g does not exist. Therefore, A and P(A)
do not have the same size.
