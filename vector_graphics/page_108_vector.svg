Context-Free Languages
3.3
Regular languages are context-free
We mentioned already that the class of context-free languages includes the
class of regular languages. In this section, we will prove this claim.
Theorem 3.3.1 Let Σ be an alphabet and let L ⊆Σ∗be a regular language.
Then L is a context-free language.
Proof.
Since L is a regular language, there exists a deterministic ﬁnite
automaton M = (Q, Σ, δ, q, F) that accepts L.
To prove that L is context-free, we have to deﬁne a context-free grammar
G = (V, Σ, R, S), such that L = L(M) = L(G). Thus, G must have the
following property: For every string w ∈Σ∗,
w ∈L(M) if and only if w ∈L(G),
which can be reformulated as
M accepts w if and only if S
∗⇒w.
We will deﬁne the context-free grammar G in such a way that the following
correspondence holds for any string w = w1w2 . . . wn:
• Assume that M is in state A just after it has read the substring
w1w2 . . . wi.
• Then in the context-free grammar G, we have S
∗⇒w1w2 . . . wiA.
In the next step, M reads the symbol wi+1 and switches from state A to,
say, state B; thus, δ(A, wi+1) = B. In order to guarantee that the above
correspondence still holds, we have to add the rule A →wi+1B to G.
Consider the moment when M has read the entire string w. Let A be the
state M is in at that moment. By the above correspondence, we have
S
∗⇒w1w2 . . . wnA = wA.
Recall that G must have the property that
M accepts w if and only if S
∗⇒w,
which is equivalent to
A ∈F if and only if S
∗⇒w.
