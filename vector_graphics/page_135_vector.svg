hold. We start with the third property, i.e., we prove that
uvixyiz ∈L, for all i ≥0.
In the grammar G, we have
S
∗⇒uAjz.
(3.3)
Since Aj
∗⇒vAky and Ak = Aj, we have
Aj
∗⇒vAjy.
(3.4)
Finally, since Ak
∗⇒x and Ak = Aj, we have
Aj
∗⇒x.
(3.5)
From (3.3) and (3.5), it follows that
S
∗⇒uAjz
∗⇒uxz,
which implies that the string uxz is in the language L. Similarly, it follows
from (3.3), (3.4), and (3.5) that
S
∗⇒uAjz
∗⇒uvAjyz
∗⇒uvvAjyyz
∗⇒uvvxyyz.
Hence, the string uv2xy2z is in the language L. In general, for each i ≥0,
the string uvixyiz is in the language L, because
S
∗⇒uAjz
∗⇒uviAjyiz
∗⇒uvixyiz.
This proves that the third property in the pumping lemma holds.
Next we show that the second property holds. That is, we prove that
|vxy| ≤p.
Consider the subtree rooted at the node storing the variable
Aj.
The path from the node storing Aj to the leaf storing the terminal
a is a longest path in this subtree. (Convince yourself that this is true.)
Moreover, this path consists of ℓ−j edges. Since Aj
∗⇒vxy, this subtree
is a parse tree for the string vxy (where Aj is used as the start variable).
Therefore, by Lemma 3.8.2, we can conclude that |vxy| ≤2ℓ−j−1. We know
that ℓ−1 −r ≤j, which is equivalent to ℓ−j −1 ≤r. It follows that
|vxy| ≤2ℓ−j−1 ≤2r = p.
