• if M2 would have read the input string up to this point, then it would
be in state r2.
This leads to the ﬁnite automaton M = (Q, Σ, δ, q, F), where
• Q = Q1 × Q2 = {(r1, r2) : r1 ∈Q1 and r2 ∈Q2}.
Observe that
|Q| = |Q1| × |Q2|, which is ﬁnite.
• Σ is the alphabet of A and B (recall that we assume that A and B are
languages over the same alphabet).
• The start state q of M is equal to q = (q1, q2).
• The set F of accept states of M is given by
F = {(r1, r2) : r1 ∈F1 or r2 ∈F2} = (F1 × Q2) ∪(Q1 × F2).
• The transition function δ : Q × Σ →Q is given by
δ((r1, r2), a) = (δ1(r1, a), δ2(r2, a)),
for all r1 ∈Q1, r2 ∈Q2, and a ∈Σ.
To ﬁnish the proof, we have to show that this ﬁnite automaton M indeed
accepts the language A∪B. Intuitively, this should be clear from the discus-
sion above. The easiest way to give a formal proof is by using the extended
transition functions δ1 and δ2. (The extended transition function has been
deﬁned after Deﬁnition 2.2.4.) Here we go: Recall that we have to prove that
M accepts w ⇔M1 accepts w or M2 accepts w,
i.e,
M accepts w ⇔δ1(q1, w) ∈F1 or δ2(q2, w) ∈F2.
In terms of the extended transition function δ of the transition function δ of
M, this becomes
δ((q1, q2), w) ∈F ⇔δ1(q1, w) ∈F1 or δ2(q2, w) ∈F2.
(2.1)
By applying the deﬁnition of the extended transition function, as given after
Deﬁnition 2.2.4, to δ, it can be seen that
δ((q1, q2), w) = (δ1(q1, w), δ2(q2, w)).
