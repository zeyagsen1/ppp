unbounded face) of this embedding, respectively. Moreover, let c be the number
of connected components of G. Then
v −e + f = c + 1.
Proof. The proof is by induction on the number of edges of G. To be more
precise, we start with a graph having no edges, and prove that the theorem
holds for this case. Then, we add the edges one by one, and show that the
relation v −e + f = c + 1 is maintained.
So we ﬁrst assume that G has no edges, i.e., e = 0. Then the embedding
consists of a collection of v points. In this case, we have f = 1 and c = v.
Hence, the relation v −e + f = c + 1 holds.
Let e > 0 and assume that Euler’s formula holds for a subgraph of G
having e −1 edges. Let {u, v} be an edge of G that is not in the subgraph,
and add this edge to the subgraph. There are two cases depending on whether
this new edge joins two connected components or joins two vertices in the
same connected component.
Case 1: The new edge {u, v} joins two connected components.
In this case, the number of vertices and the number of faces do not change,
the number of connected components goes down by 1, and the number of
edges increases by 1. It follows that the relation in the theorem is still valid.
Case 2: The new edge {u, v} joins two vertices in the same connected com-
ponent.
In this case, the number of vertices and the number of connected com-
ponents do not change, the number of edges increases by 1, and the number
of faces increases by 1 (because the new edge splits one face into two faces).
Therefore, the relation in the theorem is still valid.
Euler’s theorem is usually stated as follows:
Theorem 1.3.18 (Euler) Consider an embedding of a connected planar
graph G. Let v, e, and f be the number of vertices, edges, and faces (in-
cluding the single unbounded face) of this embedding, respectively. Then
v −e + f = 2.
