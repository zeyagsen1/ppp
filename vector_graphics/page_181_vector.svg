It follows from the pseudocode that H′ terminates on any input. We
observe the following:
• Assume that ⟨M, w⟩∈Halt. Then we have seen before that ⟨TMw⟩∈P.
Since H decides the language P, it follows that H accepts the string
⟨TMw⟩. Therefore, from the pseudocode, H′ accepts the string ⟨M, w⟩.
• Assume that ⟨M, w⟩̸∈Halt. Then we have seen before that ⟨TMw⟩̸∈
P. Since H decides the language P, it follows that H rejects (and
terminates on) the string ⟨TMw⟩. Therefore, from the pseudocode, H′
rejects (and terminates on) the string ⟨M, w⟩.
We have shown that the Turing machine H′ decides the language Halt.
This is a contradiction and, therefore, we conclude that the language P is
undecidable.
Until now, we assumed that ⟨M1⟩̸∈P. If ⟨M1⟩∈P, then we repeat the
proof with P replaced by its complement P. This revised proof then shows
that P is undecidable. Since for every language L,
L is decidable if and only if L is decidable,
we again conclude that P is undecidable.

Enumerability
We now come to the last class of languages in this chapter:
Deﬁnition 5.4.1 Let Σ be an alphabet and let A ⊆Σ∗be a language. We
say that A is enumerable, if there exists a Turing machine M, such that for
every string w ∈Σ∗, the following holds:
1. If w ∈A, then the computation of the Turing machine M, on the input
string w, terminates in the accept state.
2. If w ̸∈A, then the computation of the Turing machine M, on the input
string w, does not terminate in the accept state. That is, either the
computation terminates in the reject state or the computation does not
terminate.
